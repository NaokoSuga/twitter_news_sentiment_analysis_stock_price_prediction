2,Karma Allen,She works at a Texas hospital where a toddler tested positive for measles.,2018-08-28 11:04:51,abc-news,Nurse under investigation after posting on anti-vaccination page,https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-nurse-investigation-posting-patients-measles-anti-vaccination/story?id=57443736,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/measles-vaccine-gty-hb-180815_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,"
A nurse at a hospital in Texas where a toddler tested positive for measles has been fired after she posted about the diagnosis on an anti-vaccination website, according to hospital officials.
 
The employee's firing comes just one day after Texas Children's Hospital said it was investigating the incident.
 
""We were made aware that one of our nurses posted protected health information regarding a patient on social media,"" the hospital said in a statement Tuesday night. ""We take these matters very seriously as the privacy and well-being of our patients is always a top priority. After an internal investigation, this individual is no longer with the organization.""
 
Texas Children's Hospital in Houston said Monday it stopped a nurse from seeing patients after she reportedly posted about a young boyâs condition on an anti-vaccination group on Facebook, according to a statement.
 
She allegedly wrote about the case on the ""Proud Parents of Unvaccinated Children - Texas"" Facebook page, which has since been deleted. A concerned parent posted screenshots of the unidentified nurseâs comments on the hospital's Facebook page late Friday.
 
 
 
âI think itâs easy for us nonvaxxers to make assumptions but most of us have never and will never see one of theses diseases,â the self-identified nurse wrote, according to the screenshots. ""[F]or the first time in my career I saw measles this week. Actually most of my coworkers and the ER docs saw measles for the first time as well. And honestly, it was rough. The kid was super sick. Sick enough to be admitted to the ICU and he looked miserable.
 
âBy no means have I changed my vax stance, and I never will. But I just wanted to share my experience and how much worse it was than I expected,"" she added.
 
 
 
The nurse claimed the patient had recently traveled to a region ""where measles is very common"" and speculated that he may have contracted the disease overseas.
 
Texas Children's Hospital responded to the parentâs post on Friday, confirming that it was aware of the post.
 
âThank you for your post. We are aware of this situation and have started a thorough investigation.We take these matters very seriously,â the hospital wrote. It edited the statement later to add: âThe views of this employee do not represent that of the organization.â
 
If confirmed, the toddlerâs diagnosis would mark the stateâs eighth measles case this year. More than 100 people have been diagnosed in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 
 
 
The hospital issued a longer statement on Monday, saying it had reached out to children who may have had contact with the infected toddler.
 
âA patient treated at Texas Children's Hospital West Campus tested positive for measles. This is a highly-contagious, vaccine-preventable infection. We know vaccination is the best protection against measles,â the hospital told Houston ABC station KTRK Monday. âOur Infection Control and Prevention team immediately identified other children who may have come in contact with this patient to assess their risk and provide clinical recommendations. We have contacted all of those families.â
 
 
 
It said the nurse in question was in good standing with the licensing board, but it would not comment on her vaccination status. The hospital says it strongly encourages all staff to obtain the recommended vaccines.
 
Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets, especially coughing and sneezing, according to medical officials. Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, preceded by red spots on the face.
 
""Measles is such a concern, because one, it's preventable. We have a vaccination that can prevent it,"" Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the Harris County, Texas, Health System, told KTRK. ""And two, it's so easily transmittable to someone else. ... Vaccines save lives.â

4,Meghan Keneally,Kelli Ward is one of three Republicans vying for Sen. Jeff Flake's spot.,2018-08-28 02:27:43,abc-news,'Political correctness is like a cancer': AZ GOP candidate defends comments,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/political-correctness-cancer-arizona-republican-defends-controversial-social/story?id=57439818,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/kelli-ward-ap-171025_hpMain_5_16x9_992.jpg,"
One of the Republicans running for Senate in Arizona spent time on the last day before the primary election to parse through whether or not she meant to offend people in her recent social media posts, one of which included a suggestion there was a narrative at play when Sen. John McCain announced he was stopping his cancer treatment.
 
Kelli Ward, one of the three candidates looking to fill Sen. Jeff Flakeâs seat, had a long history of being critical of Sen. John McCain before he passed away on Saturday, and now sheâs caught up in a battle of semantics about her comments about the late senator in the two days following his death.
 
It all started on Friday, when the McCain family announced that he was ending treatment for brain cancer. That same day, Ward launched a two-day campaign bus tour. One of her aides later wrote on Facebook that the timing of the McCain announcement was planned to hurt Wardâs campaign, and Ward then commented on that post, writing: ""I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me.""
 
The post and her comment, which were posted hours before McCainâs death was announced, have since been deleted, but screengrabs of the post began circulating.
 
Ward has placed the blame on the media.
 
 
 
Adding to this, another of Ward's social media posts caused controversy today when she tweeted that ""political correctness is like a cancer!""
 
 Political correctness is like a cancer! 
 
At a news conference this afternoon, when asked to address the criticism she is receiving over the comment, especially in light of McCainâs fatal brain cancer, she said ""They have nothing to do with each other really, but political correctness is like a cancer.""
 
 
 
When asked if the ""political correctness"" tweet was intended to troll social media users, she said ""I canât see how it would be trolling, but I can see how you might misunderstand it.""
 
 .@kelliwardaz defends her earlier tweet saying that âpolitical correctness is like a cancerâ pic.twitter.com/Ob6LcWr3cX 
She also debated the fact that she previously called on McCain to step down in light of his glioblastoma diagnosis, with her argument being that since she said anyone who is unable to serve - be it for health or financial or personal reasons - should step down, and McCain was included in that group, she didn't see that as calling on him to step down.
 
 
 
She also revisited the Facebook comment controversy, saying she wanted to ""set the record straight.""
 
""The media quickly ran with a false narrative that I was being insensitive to Senator McCain at a time when he found himself in dire straights. To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at Senator McCain or his family or his team. My comments were in reference to the media, and a lot of you know Iâve been kinda critical of the media â not quite as critical as the president has been but Iâve been critical of you as well â and that the media sometimes might hope for a narrative that might hinder the momentum of our campaign. And that momentum is huge,"" she said.
 
 
 
""Our differences were purely politicalâ¦ the media they tried to make them out as personal,"" she said of she and McCain.
 
 
 
At one point, someone asked if she were to win Flake's Senate seat, and if Senator Chuck Schumer's proposal to rename the Senate building after McCain passes, then she could be working in a building named after McCain. In response, she seemed to shrug.
 
""I mean you know thatâs going to be up to whoeverâs there and weâll see what happens. You know I have to fly out of the McCain terminal sometimes here so..."" she said, referencing one of the Phoenix airport terminals named after him.",0.101,0.851,0.048,-0.9872

6,The Associated Press,He was among 20 individuals and organizations banned for spreading hate.,2018-08-27 10:26:19,abc-news,Myanmar military chief among those banned by Facebook,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/myanmar-military-chief-banned-facebook-57421062,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_86828a77b1c1446e96826da60a57aed8_16x9_992.jpg,"
 
Facebook said Monday that it is banning Myanmar's powerful military chief and 19 other individuals and organizations from its site to prevent the spread of hate and misinformation. 
The social media giant was heavily criticized for permitting itself to be used to inflame ethnic and religious conflict in the country, particularly against minority Rohingya Muslims. It has been accused of being lax in fighting online misinformation and manipulation in many countries, but Myanmar is one where it has been most closely tied to deadly violence. 
Some 700,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar's western state of Rakhine over the past year in response to a brutal counterinsurgency campaign by the military, which has been accused of massive human rights violations. Critics accuse the military of carrying out ethnic cleansing, or even genocide, an allegation denied by the government, which says it was responding to attacks on security forces. 
Facebook said it also targeted pages and accounts that pretended to provide independent news and opinion, while covertly promoting messages of Myanmar's military. It said it was deleting 18 Facebook accounts, one Instagram account and 52 Facebook pages. 
A separate report by investigators working for the U.N.'s top human rights body, released Monday, charged that ""Facebook has been a useful instrument for those seeking to spread hate, in a context where for most users Facebook is the internet."" 
""Although improved in recent months, Facebook's response has been slow and ineffective,"" said the report by the Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, authorized by the U.N. Human Rights Council. ""The extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discrimination and violence must be independently and thoroughly examined."" 
Four high-ranking officers and two military units targeted by Facebook were also put on a U.S. government blacklist earlier this month for human rights abuses. The sanctions block any property they own within the U.S. and prohibit U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with them. The U.S. already maintains restrictions on visas, arms sales and assistance to Myanmar's military. In June, the EU imposed similar sanctions on seven senior army and police officers, all of whom are on Facebook's blacklist. 
Six officers on Facebook's list were also named in the U.N. human rights report, which said Myanmar's top leaders should be prosecuted for genocide. Those it recommended as ""priority subjects for investigation and prosecution"" included top commander Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. 
In a statement, Facebook referred to the U.N. report, which it said ""found evidence that many of these individuals and organizations committed or enabled serious human rights abuses in the country. And we want to prevent them from using our service to further inflame ethnic and religious tensions."" Discrimination against the Rohingya ran deep and wide even before the spread of Facebook. 
Facebook has been under pressure for several months to take action on the problem, especially after civic and rights groups in Myanmar said in April that it had failed to adequately act against online hate speech that incited violence against the country's Muslim minorities, neglecting to effectively enforce its own rules. 
""The ethnic violence in Myanmar has been truly horrific,"" Facebook said in its statement. ""While we were too slow to act, we're now making progress â with better technology to identify hate speech, improved reporting tools, and more people to review content."" 
""We continue to work to prevent the misuse of Facebook in Myanmar â including through the independent human rights impact assessment we commissioned earlier in the year. This is a huge responsibility given so many people there rely on Facebook for information â more so than in almost any other country given the nascent state of the news media and the recent rapid adoption of mobile phones. It's why we're so determined to do better in the future."" 
Yangon-based political analyst David Mathieson said that Facebook's action, together with the damning U.N. report, force Myanmar's military brass ""into an isolation they're not going to like."" 
""They have to find alternative ways to communicate with the Myanmar population, because Facebook really is the internet for many people here. And Facebook just excommunicated the commander in chief from the worldwide web,"" he told The Associated Press.",0.152,0.767,0.08,-0.9965

Members of the country's most influential tech companies met Friday to prepare for misinformation campaigns by foreign countries, including Russia, ahead of the midterm elections in November.
 
At least one company confirmed Friday's meeting, held in San Francisco, to ABC News.
 
The companies plan to discuss efforts to defend their platforms from the type of meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential election.
 
The meeting was first reported in BuzzFeed.
 
It comes after a tumultuous week in the cyber landscape. Microsoft announced Tuesday it took control of half a dozen websites that had been operated by the Russian military intelligence agency that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.
 
On Wednesday, Facebook and Twitter suspended or removed hundreds of accounts linked to Russia and Iran that displayed âinauthentic behavior.â
 
 
 
Fridayâs meeting comes on the heels of a meeting that took place in May between the top tech companies and United States intelligence officials. That meeting occurred at Facebookâs headquarters and included Twitter, Snap, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Oath, according to the New York Times.
 
 
 
According to reports, the tech companies walked away disappointed because intelligence officials refused to share information.
 
Tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, have come under heavy fire after federal authorities announced that Russian agents launched a misinformation campaign on social media in the United States during the 2016 election.
 
 
 
Earlier this month, a number of top U.S. national security leaders gathered in the White House Press Briefing Room and shared the same message: Russia is continuing to interfere in the U.S. political system.
 
 
 
At the time, Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen said: âFree and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and it has become clear that they are the target of our adversaries who seek to sow discord and undermine our way of life.â
 
 
 
In February, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russians, all members of a Russian intelligence agency, for trying to hack Democratsâ emails and computer networks.

Find the top news online at ABC news.",2018-08-24 17:45:08,abc-news,FireEye: Tech firms' secret weapon against disinformation,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/fireeye-tech-firms-secret-weapon-disinformation-57383874,,"
 
This week has seen major social media sites step up their policing of online disinformation campaigns. 
Google disabled dozens of YouTube channels and other accounts linked to a state-run Iranian broadcaster running a political-influence campaign. 
Facebook removed 652 suspicious pages, groups and accounts linked to Russia and Iran. 
Twitter took similar action shortly thereafter. 
What did they have in common? The security firm FireEye. 
Best known for its work on high-profile cyberattacks against companies including Target, JPMorgan Chase and Sony Pictures, FireEye is emerging as a key player in the fight against election interference and disinformation campaigns. 
Founded in 2004, FireEye is based in Silicon Valley and staffed with a roster of former military and law-enforcement cyberexperts. 
""They've really become the Navy SEALs of cybersecurity, especially for next-generation cybersecurity threats,"" said GBH Insights analyst Dan Ives. 
Lee Foster, manager of information operations analysis at FireEye, said his team works within the company's intelligence outfit, which researches not only ""info-ops"" â like the Iran-linked social media activity it recently uncovered â but espionage, financial crime and other forms of vulnerability and exploitation. Specialist teams at FireEye focus on particular areas of cyberthreats, each with their own expertise and language capabilities. 
""We kind of operate like a private-sector intelligence operation,"" he said. 
FireEye was founded by Ashar Aziz, who developed a system for spotting threats that haven't been tracked before, unlike older companies that sold firewalls or anti-virus programs that block known malware. 
Aziz, a former Sun Microsystems engineer, created a system that uses software to simulate a computer network and check programs for suspicious behavior, before allowing them into the network itself. 
FireEye raised its profile in 2014 by acquiring Mandiant, known for expertise in assessing damage and tracing the source of cyberattacks. Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia, a former U.S. Air Force investigator, is now FireEye's CEO. 
While businesses are spending more on information security, FireEye itself has spent heavily on research, development, sales and marketing. That has led to struggles to remain profitable, as heavy investments offset revenue growth. 
Mandia said that during the three months ended June 30, FireEye's email security found 6 million spear-phishing attacks, a type of hacking, and its security products alerted companies of attempts to breach security 29 million times. That's important, Mandia said, because most of FireEye's products are deployed behind their client's existing firewalls or antivirus software, so everything FireEye catches has already evaded other defenses, he said. 
""We are the investigators called in when the processes, people, and technology fail to prevent a security breach or incident,"" he said. ""We find the gaps in the security fabric and we find the needle in the haystack."" 
FireEye Inc.'s second-quarter revenue rose 6 percent to $203 million but it lost $72.9 million, or 38 cents per share. That met Wall Street's expectations, but its shares fell as investors expected more. 
That's a common problem in the white-hot cybersecurity sector, which includes competitors like Palo Alto Networks, CloudFlare and Check Point. The companies are facing high expectations as the cybersecurity market booms, fueled by heightened cyberattacks and hacking fears. 
""As the space has become more competitive ... profitability and growth has been a challenge for (FireEye),"" Ives said. 
Still, FireEye's stock jumped 6 percent on Thursday when news broke of its role in uncovering the fake accounts on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. It was up another 3 percent Friday. 
FireEye shares hit their all-time peak of $95.63 on March 5, 2014, a few months after they went public, but began a long decline after that, hitting an all-time low of $10.40 almost exactly three years later on March 14, 2017. In the past month the stock has traded between $14.38 and $16.69. 
And the company's reputation continues to grow. 
""There are many vendors that play in cybersecurity when you look at some of the very sophisticated threats facing enterprise and governments,"" Ives said. ""FireEye many times gets that first phone call when it comes to assess threat environment for companies.""

President Trump on Friday continued his tirade against social media companies who have moved to suspend accounts they have identified as intentionally disseminating fake news, inaccurately claiming ""millions"" of voices are being silenced.
 
""Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""Canât do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN, whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!""
 
 Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Canât do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN, whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship! 
 
The president's tweet followed an announcement by Facebook on Tuesday that it had identified and removed 652 accounts and groups it deemed had ""coordinated inauthentic behavior,"" including several it said were linked to Iran and Russia.
 
 
 
Trump has previously accused social media companies of targeting only conservative voices in their recent crackdowns against accounts like that of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
 
Facebook earlier this month removed content from several of Jones' pages and his organization ""InfoWars,"" saying content promoted by their accounts violated their hate speech policies by ""glorifying violence ... and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.""

A Pennsylvania man who threatened to kill President Donald Trump back in June is still on the run and was last seen in Cumberland, Maryland, earlier this week in a stolen truck, the U.S. Marshals Service said.
 
A warrant was issued June 19 for 27-year-old Shawn Richard Christy and he remains wanted by federal authorities for threatening other elected officials as well.
 
Authorities have not been able to locate Christy since the warrant was issued. He drew federal authorities attention with his remarks about the president on Facebook and his previous behavior.
 
According to court documents, Christy, in a threatening post on Facebook to Northampton County, Pennsylvania District Attorney John Morganelli, wrote: âKeep it up Morganelli, I promise Iâll put a bullet in your head as soon as I put one in the head of President Donald J. Trump.â
 
Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Robert Clark told ABC News the stolen red pickup truck was recovered Tuesday, in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, near Christy's hometown of McAdoo.
 
Christy is considered by the U.S. Marshals, FBI and U.S. Secret Service to be armed and dangerous.
 
Authorities say Christy has a distinct lisp and a barbed wire cross tattoo on his upper right arm. He also, according to authorities, considers himself a survivalist.
 
Christy also said that he was going to use ""lethal force"" on any law enforcement attempting to detain him. He made the comments between June 3-12.
 
The reward for any information is now up to $20,000 and the three agencies are asking for the public's help with any information leading to Christy.
 
He is also wanted in Pennsylvania for burglary, probation violation and failure to appear for an aggravated assault case.
 
""Persons having information should contact the U.S. Marshals at 1-877-Wanted-2 (1-877-926-8332) or the FBI at 215-418-4000,"" a release from the Marshals said.
 
""Individuals should not attempt to arrest Christy themselves,"" the release said.
 
 
 
This is not the only time Christy has made threats against a public official.
 
In an interview with Newsweek, Shawn Christy's father, Craig, said that his son explained to him how he hid from law enforcement and noted that he has various guns on his possession that he had taken from the home.
 
Last year, according to the Associated Press he swung a stick at the McAdoo mayor over a dispute about snow plowing.
 
He's also had problems with former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who filed a restraining order against then 18-year-old Christy in 2010.
 
A year later he pleaded guilty to making harassing phone calls to Palin, her family members and lawyers.
 
""This is one of the stalkers who has tormented my family for years. Threatening my kids and my parents, following my daughters, moving to Alaska, then following Bristol to Texas to more aggressively physically invade and intimidate... itâs been a hellish ride with these stalkers... as weâve informed the FBI and law enforcement for years,"" Palin said in a Facebook post August 20.
 
""Finally, perhaps, in this particular case with one of the stalkers - Shawn Christy (having recently threatened the President) justice may prevail.""

11,The Associated Press,Authorities say a New York man who was arrested for falsely claiming he was owed half-ownership of Facebook but then fled the country has been captured in Ecuador,2018-08-23 20:33:08,abc-news,Wannabe Facebook owner who fled arrest is caught in Ecuador,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/wannabe-facebook-owner-fled-arrest-caught-ecuador-57365693,,"
 
A New York man who was arrested for falsely claiming he was owed half-ownership of Facebook but then fled the country has been captured in Ecuador, authorities said Thursday. 
Prosecutors notified a judge presiding over his case in Manhattan federal court that Paul Ceglia was arrested in the morning. They said he'll appear in a court in Quito, Ecuador's capital, within a day. 
Robert Ross Fogg, Ceglia's defense lawyer, said he was surprised at news of his client's capture, but ""mostly relieved that he was located without incident and hope the family has maintained good health."" 
""Look forward to his return and resuming our vigorous defense of his case,"" Fogg said in an email. 
Nikki Credic-Barrett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service, said the agency had no information on the matter because Ceglia was in the custody of Ecuadorian law enforcement authorities. 
Ceglia, 45, was arrested on fraud charges in October 2012. 
While under house arrest in Wellsville, New York, in March 2015 he disappeared with his wife and two young sons and the family's dog. Authorities said he sliced off his electronic monitoring device and created a crude contraption to make it seem he was moving around his home. 
Prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick they would update him on the status of extradition attempts. 
Ceglia claimed in a lawsuit that he gave Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg $1,000 in startup money in exchange for 50 percent of the future company in 2003 as part of a software development contract. 
Facebook lawyers said Ceglia and Zuckerberg did have a contract but references to Facebook were slipped in for purposes of the lawsuit. 
The lawsuit was tossed out by a judge in Buffalo, New York, in 2014. Prosecutors then filed fraud charges after a forensic analysis of Ceglia's computers and Harvard's email archive determined he had altered an unrelated contract and falsified emails to make it seem Zuckerberg had promised him a half-share. 
Ceglia maintained he was not guilty before he vanished. Mail and wire fraud charges against him carry a potential maximum sentence of 40 years in prison if he is convicted.",0.162,0.77,0.068,-0.9916
12,John Verhovek,"Amid two recent discoveries of disinformation campaigns on Facebook, ProPublica created a tool to track and analyze political advertisements on the social media platform.",2018-08-23 19:21:31,abc-news,"As midterms approach, new tool helps track political advertising on Facebook",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/midterms-approach-tool-helps-track-political-advertising-facebook/story?id=57335151,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/facebook-headquarters-01-as-gty-180822_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,"
In the 2016 presidential election Facebook and other social media platforms were utilized by political campaigns and interest groups to run advertisements with very few rules regulating their disclosure and little public information about their source.
 
The lack of knowledge about these advertisements underscored the ease with which political actors, both foreign and domestic, were able to manipulate platforms like Facebook to disseminate misleading and often false information to Facebook users in the United States and around the world.
 
The spread of misinformation meant to foment political discord and stir unrest continues to be a concern less than three months out from a consequential midterm election. Just this week Facebook announced it removed ""652 pages, groups and accounts for coordinated inauthentic behavior that originated in Iran and targeted people across multiple internet services in the Middle East, Latin America, UK and US.""
 
Facebook also said it ""removed multiple pages, groups and accounts"" linked to ""inauthentic behavior"" on its platforms, including actions that originated in Russia.
 
 
 
Aside from the threat from nefarious actors, Facebook's influence as a medium through which American politicians and campaigns communicate with voters has skyrocketed in the last decade. But exactly how that influence and power is being yielded by politicians, campaigns and outside groups from all sides of the political spectrum still remains somewhat of a mystery due to the lack of rules governing the disclosure of that information.
 
 
 
In order to better understand the tactics and strategies of all political actors on Facebook, ABC News is partnering with ProPublica, a nonprofit, award-winning news organization that has built a tool to collect information and data on political ads that are being targeted to users of the social media giant.
 
ProPublica's tool is a simple, free browser plugin on a Firefox or Google Chrome web browser, that Facebook users can opt into and report political advertisements they see on the site. Those advertisements will then be collected by ProPublica in a public database to track and analyze advertisements on Facebook.
 
ABC News and other news organizations will then use that database and information to better understand and report on how political actors are utilizing one of the most powerful communication mediums on the planet.
 
Thus far the tool has gathered almost 60,000 individual advertisements from over 12,500 contributors, according to ProPublica.
 
ProPublica clearly states: ""The tool doesn't collect your personal information,"" and privacy controls ensure that the information that is being collected relates only to the advertisement that appeared on the site.
 
 
 
Earlier this year Facebook announced steps to make the source of political advertisements on the site more transparent and understandable, but has still not given news organizations or academic institutions full and total access to all of the data behind what goes into purchasing and targeting those ads.
 
The site has created its own archive of political advertisements that allows users to obtain ""more information about some of the ads they see and the advertisers who are funding them,"" according to Facebook. But that archive remains an incomplete picture of how political advertisements are tailored to certain users because it does not show who was targeted with the ad.
 
By utilizing ProPublica's tool to track advertisements, Facebook users can more easily report political advertising, giving news organizations more data to gather and a greater ability to understand, analyze, fact-check and investigate political communication on the site.
 
Already the tool has helped locate political ads that were actually scams and malware, political ads that were ignore federal election rules by not disclosing who funded them, and uncovered a fake Facebook page claiming to belong to Special Counsel Robert Mueller with more than 100,000 followers.
 
The midterms are fast approaching, and ProPublica's tool will be a key asset in understanding how politicians, their campaigns, and powerful outside interest groups are using the medium to communicate with voters.

Google announced Thursday it had disabled dozens of YouTube channels and other accounts linked to a state-run Iranian broadcaster for a political influence campaign. 
The security firm FireEye, which alerted tech companies to some of the suspicious activity, said in a report this week that the overall operation originates from Iran and promotes Iranian interests to audiences in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
Google said its own forensic research shows the accounts were set up by people associated with the state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, or IRIB. 
The broadcaster didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Thursday. FireEye said it's a sign that it's no longer just Russia conducting disguised political influence campaigns. 
On Tuesday, Facebook â which also works with FireEye â revealed that it had removed 652 suspicious pages, groups and accounts linked to Russia and Iran. Twitter made a similar announcement shortly thereafter. 
Tech companies have become much more proactive about sleuthing out and dealing with political influence campaigns since last year, when Facebook, Google and Twitter acknowledged allowing Russian agents to spread propaganda on their networks during the 2016 presidential campaign. 
Several are going further, offering specific help to protect U.S. political candidates from Russian hackers and other bad actors ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. In so doing, they're confronting another question: Could that free help count as an illegal campaign contribution? 
Microsoft, for instance, has gone so far as to request an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission to make sure its new free package of online security protections for ""election-sensitive"" customers doesn't count as an in-kind campaign contribution. Companies are typically prohibited from contributing to federal candidates and political committees under federal law. 
Microsoft said this week it's offering its AccountGuard service on a nonpartisan basis to federal, state and local candidates, party committees and certain nonprofit groups. The company told FEC it might also work with other tech firms such as Facebook and Twitter on coordinated election security efforts, though no agreements have been made. 
Google last year also launched what it calls its Advanced Protection Program, which uses security keys to protect high-risk potential hacking targets such as politicians, as well as journalists and business leaders. 
At least one prominent security expert believes it may be too late to protect November's midterms from further interference. Alex Stamos, who stepped down as Facebook's security chief last week, said in an online essay that U.S. officials haven't taken the threats seriously enough. 
He cited Microsoft's revelation early this week that it discovered efforts by a hacking group tied to the Russian government to spoof websites belonging to the U.S. Senate and two conservative institutions. Such fake websites have previously been used by the group known as Fancy Bear to trick targeted victims into letting their computers be infiltrated. 
Stamos said that ""In some ways, the United States has broadcast to the world that it doesn't take these issues seriously and that any perpetrators of information warfare against the West will get, at most, a slap on the wrist."" 
He said ""this failure has left the U.S. unprepared to protect the 2018 elections,"" though there's ""still a chance to defend American democracy in 2020."" 
Obtaining the FEC's opinion could take Microsoft a few months, but the company said that won't stop it from moving ahead with the service immediately. Microsoft said it believes there's precedent for charging political and non-political customers different rates. 
The midterm election is on Nov. 6, though many states have already held their primaries. 
Company lawyers told the FEC that along with trying to help democracy, Microsoft has a ""compelling business interest in maintaining its brand reputation"" amid continued public focus on Russian efforts to influence this year's election. They said Microsoft's reputation would suffer if hackers breached Microsoft accounts belonging to election-sensitive customers.",0.05,0.859,0.091,0.9553

Police acting on a complaint by Thailand's ruling junta have charged the leaders of a new political party that strongly opposes military rule with violating the computer crime law, which could result in five-year prison terms. 
Future Forward party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit and two other senior party members were charged by police this week with violating a section of the law that makes it a crime to transmit false information or information that damages the country's stability, group spokeswoman Pannika Wanich said Thursday. 
She said the charges involve a June 29 Facebook live video posted on the pages of Thanathorn and the party, but did not describe how it may have violated the law. She said police had issued summonses in the past few days for the three party members to turn themselves in on Friday, but they had busy schedules and would ask for the date to be postponed to the middle of next month. 
""And since all three have now officially become defendants in the case, our legal team needs some time to prepare,"" she said. 
The Future Forward party is a new grouping featuring young politicians and is viewed as offering a real alternative to the ruling junta and its allies in upcoming elections. 
Thailand's military government has kept a tight lid on dissent since it seized power from an elected government in a 2014 coup. It has promised to hold elections by early next year in a contest its critics charge will be set up to ensure it continues its influence over the country's administration. 
The junta has already pushed back several promised election dates. Prime Minister and junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha said Tuesday that the next polls are still scheduled for Feb. 24, though he did not entirely rule out another delay. 
Pannika said a junta official had filed a police complaint against Thanathorn and his colleagues and had provided a brief explanation of the charges to local media. 
The country's biggest newspaper, Thai Rath, said Col. Burin Thongprapai, a legal officer for the junta, stated last month that he filed the charges because in the Facebook live broadcast Thanathorn had made accusations against the junta and twisted facts in a manner that amounted to an attack on Thailand's justice system.",0.114,0.803,0.083,-0.8674

Facebook has pulled one of its own products from Apple's app store because it didn't want to stop tracking what people were doing on their iPhones. Facebook also banned a quiz app from its social network for possible privacy intrusions on about 4 million users. 
The twin developments come as Facebook is under intense scrutiny over privacy following the Cambridge Analytica scandal earlier this year. Allegations that the political consultancy used personal information harvested from 87 million Facebook accounts have dented Facebook's reputation. 
Since the scandal broke, Facebook has investigated thousands of apps and suspended more than 400 of them over data-sharing concerns. 
The social media company said late Wednesday that it took action against the myPersonality quiz app, saying that its creators refused an inspection. But even as Facebook did that, it found its own Onavo Protect security app at odds with Apple's tighter rules for applications. 
Onavo Protect is a virtual-private network service aimed at helping users secure their personal information over public Wi-Fi networks. The app also alerts users when other apps use too much data. 
Since acquiring Onavo in 2013, Facebook has used it to track what apps people were using on phones. This surveillance helped Facebook detect trendy services, tipping off the company to startups it might want to buy and areas it might want to work on for upcoming features. 
Facebook said in a statement that it has ""always been clear when people download Onavo about the information that is collected and how it is used."" 
But Onavo fell out of compliance with Apple's app-store guidelines after they were tightened two months ago to protect the reservoir of personal information that people keep on their iPhones and iPads. 
Apple's revised guidelines require apps to get users' express consent before recording and logging their activity on a device. According to Apple, the new rules also ""made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a user's device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing."" 
Facebook will still be able to deploy Onavo on devices powered by Google's Android software. 
Onavo's ouster from Apple's app store widens the rift between two of the world's most popular companies. 
Apple CEO Tim Cook has been outspoken in his belief that Facebook does a shoddy job of protecting its 2.2 billion users' privacy â something that he has framed as ""a fundamental human right.""  
Cook sharpened his criticism following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. He emphasized that Apple would never be caught in the same situation as Facebook because it doesn't collect information about its customers to sell advertising. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg fired back in a separate interview and called Cook's remarks ""extremely glib."" Zuckerberg implied that Apple caters primarily to rich people with a line of products that includes the $1,000 iPhone X. 
Late Wednesday, Facebook said it moved to ban the myPersonality app after it found user information was shared with researchers and companies ""with only limited protections in place."" The company said it would notify the app's users that their data may have been misused. 
It said myPersonality was ""mainly active"" prior to 2012. Though Facebook has tightened its rules since then, it is only now reviewing those older apps following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. 
The app was created in 2007 by researcher David Stillwell and allowed users to take a personality questionnaire and get feedback on the results. 
""There was no misuse of personal data,"" Stillwell said in a statement, adding that ""this ban appears to be purely cosmetic."" Stillwell said users gave their consent and the app's data was fully anonymized before it was used for academic research. He also rejected Facebook's assertion that he refused to submit to an audit.",0.074,0.865,0.061,-0.8716

Facebook, Twitter and Google routinely squabble for users, engineers and advertising money. Yet it makes sense for these tech giants to work together on security threats, elections meddling and other common ills. 
Such cooperation was evident Tuesday when Facebook announced that it had removed 652 suspicious pages, groups and accounts linked to Russia and Iran. This was followed by similar news from Twitter. On Monday, meanwhile, Microsoft reported a new Russian effort to impersonate conservative U.S. websites, potentially as part of an espionage campaign. 
Cooperation makes it easier for tech companies to combat fraudulent use of their services. It also makes them look good in the eyes of their users and regulators by showing that they take the threats seriously enough to set aside competitive differences. 
They have little other choice if they want to avoid regulation and stay ahead of â or just keep up with â the malicious actors, who are getting smarter and smarter at evading the tech companies' controls. 
Case in point: While Facebook said there was no evidence that Russian and Iranian actors cooperated with each other in the latest efforts to create fake accounts to mislead users, the company said their tactics were similar. In other words, if the bad guys are learning from each other, the companies fighting them would need to do the same. 
Facebook has significantly stepped up policing of its services since last year, when it acknowledged that Russian agents successfully used Facebook to run political influence operations aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential election. 
Other social media companies have done likewise and continue to turn up fresh evidence of political disinformation campaigns. While some of the 2016 disruptions seemed to support certain candidates, more recent campaigns appear aimed at sowing discord and driving people to more extreme sides of the political stage. 
Tech companies already share information to fight terrorism, child pornography, malware and spam. They are now adding global political threats from nation-states. In congressional hearings earlier this year, Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said Facebook, Twitter and Google have a ""long history"" of working together on such threats. He expressed hope that sharing information becomes ""industry standard practice."" 
Understanding the threat requires understanding how the malicious actors communicate, operate and move among various services, Facebook said in a blog post on Tuesday. ""To help gather this information, we often share intelligence with other companies once we have a basic grasp of what's happening,"" the company wrote. 
Even with all the cooperation, disagreements exist. The companies don't always agree on when and how to go public with threats they uncover, for example. And while critics have called for a formal industry body to address issues such as elections meddling, misinformation and hate speech on social networks, no such broad-reaching organization exists.Â  
The closest is the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, which Microsoft, Facebook and other companies formed to protect businesses and users from internet crime. But bigshots such as Google and Twitter were noticeably missing. (Those companies did not respond to messages Wednesday asking if they have joined since).Â  
Nonetheless, cooperation has helped other industries stave off regulation. For example, the movie industry banded together to develop its own ratings system in the 1960s to ward off government censorship. 
Jeff Bardin, chief information officer at the security firm Treadstone 71, said cooperation is one way to combat fake accounts without imposing tighter verification when users sign up. Of course, if Facebook started asking potential members for a government-issued ID and a home address, it would drive people away. 
""There is no way they will do that upfront,"" he said. So, what's left is to continue to play the cat-and-mouse game, catching and removing the enemy and then learning its new tactics as it changes them.",0.124,0.799,0.077,-0.9868

The TAKE with Rick Klein
 
Two former top aides to President Donald Trump played opposite sides of the loyalty card to the same stunning conclusion: guilty pronouncements in federal court.
 
But that won't be the final word â not even close.
 
Perhaps the most mind-blowing hour of the Trump presidency brought anything but finality to the legal sagas surrounding the Trump presidency.
 
By far the most damaging revelations come courtesy of Michael Cohen. He pleaded guilty to crimes he admits to committing while serving as the president's personal attorney, and in the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign.
 
Trump's pit bull and longtime fixer, his lawyer says, implicated the president in the commission of a felony in open court. Cohen's plea agreement also states that he acted ""at the request and suggestion of one or more members of the campaign.""
 
Forget the focus in recent weeks on whether Trump will talk with Robert Mueller's team. The people closest to the president continue to talk plenty loud on his behalf.
 
The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks
 
The accusations lobbed against the president's team from Cohen bring with them serious questions about consequences.
 
What happens - or what should happen - when a president or a president's campaign is mentioned in the same context as the details of a crime?
 
While the country grapples with that, Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, is already facing serious and tangible consequences in the form of jail time for crimes he was convicted of Tuesday.
 
 
 
The president continues to call the special counsel's work a 'witch hunt,' but it is now a hunt that has landed guilty verdicts and pleas.
 
Manafort was found guilty for misleading the government and evading taxes. While none of those charges had to do with the president or his campaign, they carry significant time behind bars.
 
Considering the gravity of the offenses, and the fact that President Trump has presented himself as tough on crime politically, it was surprising to hear him continue to defend Manafort and downplay the charges, saying he felt ""badly"" for his former adviser.
 
While the jurors were torn on some counts facing Manafort -- they did all agree to convict on eight counts, after all.
 
The TIP with Trish Turner
 
As eight guilty counts against him were read Tuesday afternoon, Paul Manafort â made to stand and face the jury of six men and six women â stared expressionless. Two female jurors turned their chairs toward him and appeared to look angry, a change from their normally sunny demeanor.
 
Manafort's wife, Kathleen, showed no emotion, staring straight ahead, nodding her head only slightly as a friend comfortingly stroked her arm.
 
When the jury left the room, Judge T.S. Ellis showed a rare moment of emotion. Throughout the trial, tensions had run high. Unexpected threats against him prompted marshals to protect him outside the courthouse. He addressed criticism of his combative demeanor during the trial. ""We all take brickbats in life,"" Ellis said, recalling his comment during the trial that he is a ""Caesar"" in his ""own Rome.""
 
 
 
""Even in my own Rome, I was far less supreme than Caesar,"" Ellis told those gathered â mostly journalists.
 
His voice cracked as he complimented both legal teams. ""Mr. Manafort received very effective and zealous counsel. That's not a statement I make as often as I would like to,"" he said.
 
As Manafort was led away by two marshals, he looked at his wife and winked.
 
And with that, he left for jail â where he will await not only sentencing in Virginia, but also a separate trial in next month in Washington, D.C.

Facebook has identified and banned hundreds of accounts, groups and pages engaged in misleading political behavior, a far larger discovery than a ""sophisticated"" effort it reported three weeks ago with great fanfare. 
The social network said Tuesday that it had removed 652 pages, groups, and accounts linked to Russia and, unexpectedly, Iran, for ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" that included the sharing of political material. 
Facebook has significantly stepped up policing of its platform since last year, when it acknowledged that Russian agents successfully ran political influence operations on its platform that were aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential election. Other social media networks have done likewise, and continue to turn up fresh evidence of political disinformation campaigns. 
Facebook's action in late July against 32 accounts possibly linked to Russia generally involved U.S. political activity ahead of the midterm elections in November. By contrast, the latest group of apparently fake accounts appeared more intent on influencing U.S. foreign policy and regional politics in the Middle East. 
Shortly after Facebook's announcement, Twitter revealed that it had also suspended 284 accounts for ""coordinated manipulation,"" many of them apparently originating from Iran. A day earlier, Microsoft also reported a new Russian effort to impersonate conservative U.S. websites , potentially as part of an espionage campaign. 
The social network said it had not concluded its review of the material and declined to say how or why the state-backed actors were behaving the way they did. But it said it has informed the U.S. and U.K. governments as well as the U.S. Treasury and State departments because of ongoing sanctions against Iran. 
""There's a lot we don't know yet,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a hastily called conference call with reporters Tuesday afternoon. 
""You're going to see people try to abuse the services in every way possible ... including now nation states,"" he said. He described the deception campaigns as ""sophisticated and well-funded efforts that aren't going to stop."" 
FireEye, a cybersecurity firm that alerted Facebook to some of this activity, noted that it ""does not appear to have been specifically designed to influence the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, as it extends well beyond U.S. audiences and U.S. politics."" 
Facebook said its latest action on Tuesday morning resulted from four investigations â three involving Iran, one involving Russia. 
The first focused on a group called ""Liberty Front Press"" that set up multiple accounts on Facebook and Instagram that were followed by 155,000 other accounts. The group was linked to Iranian state media based on website registrations, IP addresses and administrator accounts, Facebook said. The first accounts were created in 2013 and posted political content about the Middle East, the U.K., and the U.S., although the focus on the West increased starting last year, Facebook said. 
""The Iranians are now following the Kremlin's playbook,"" said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. On Sept. 5, leaders of Facebook, Google and Twitter are scheduled to testify before the intelligence committee about their efforts to combat political disinformation on their social media networks. 
FireEye called the Liberty Front Press group an influence operation apparently aimed at promoting Iranian political interests ""including anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes"" and support for the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. 
President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from that agreement earlier this year. 
While that group did not appear to be attempting to influence the U.S. midterms, FireEye said its analysis ""does not preclude such attempts being made."" Several social media personas it found related to the group masqueraded as liberal U.S. activists who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders. One persona also used the Twitter handle ""@berniecratss"" and listed its location as the United States even though the phone number associated with it began with Iran's country code, +98. 
The group's activity included ""significant anti-Trump messaging,"" but FireEye said in a detailed report ""the activity extends well beyond U.S. audiences and U.S. politics."" 
The second group also had multiple accounts and 15,000 followers. The group was linked to ""Liberty Front Press"" and attempted to hack people's accounts to spread malware. Facebook said it disrupted those attempts. 
A third group also operated out of Iran had as many as 813,000 followers, and also shared political content about the Middle East, the U.K. and U.S. 
In all the Iranian-linked groups spent some $12,000 in advertising and hosted 28 different events. 
A fourth group that attempted to influence politics in Syria and the Ukraine was connected to sources that Facebook said the U.S. had linked to Russian military intelligence. 
""We're working closely with U.S. law enforcement on this investigation,"" Facebook said in a blog post .

Facebook said on Tuesday it's ""removed multiple pages, groups and accounts"" linked to ""inauthentic behavior"" on its platforms, including actions that originated in Russia and in Iran.
 
""These were distinct campaigns and we have not identified any link or coordination between them,"" the Menlo Park, California-based social media giant said in a statement posted online. ""However, they used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing.""
 
""We ban this kind of behavior,"" the statement continued, ""because we want people to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook. And while we're making progress rooting out this abuse, as we've said before, it's an ongoing challenge because the people responsible are determined and well funded.""
 
Facebook's market cap at the close of business on Tuesday was approximately half a trillion dollars.
 
 
 
""There is always a tension between taking down these bad actors quickly and improving our defenses over the long term,"" Facebook's statement continued. ""If we remove them too early, it's harder to understand their playbook and the extent of their network. It also limits our ability to coordinate with law enforcement, who often have investigations of their own.""
 
The statement included comments attributed to Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy, who said Facebook has removed ""652 pages, groups and accounts for coordinated inauthentic behavior that originated in Iran and targeted people across multiple internet services in the Middle East, Latin America, UK and US.""
 
""We're working closely with U.S. law enforcement on this investigation, and we appreciate their help,"" Gleicher wrote. ""These investigations are ongoing -- and given the sensitivity we aren't sharing more information about what we removed.""
 
 
 
 
 
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement after Facebook's announcement that ""this is further evidence that foreign adversaries are actively using social media to divide Americans and undermine our democratic institutions.""
 
""I've been saying for months,"" Warner's statement continued, ""that there's no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt. We also learned today that the Iranians are now following the Kremlin's playbook from 2016. While I'm encouraged to see Facebook taking steps to rid their platforms of these bad actors, there's clearly more work to be done.""
 
Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to field more questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee at a hearing on Sept. 5.
 
 
 
Twitter also announced late Tuesday that it had suspended 284 accounts ""for engaging in coordinated manipulation.""
 
""Based on our existing analysis,"" the company said in a Tweet, ""it appears many of these accounts originated from Iran.""

Getty                                       More than 100 employees have rallied in a group on Facebook's internal Workplace messageboard founded by a conservative employee to protest what they alleged is an ""intolerant"" culture towards conservatism.   Posters promoting the group and attacking the ""outrage mob"" have appeared around campus, and debates among employees have broken out across Facebook Workplace over the company's approach to politics.   There have also previously been some incidents in which Facebook employees have refused to work with or talk to certain colleagues because of their political beliefs, an employee told Business Insider.   ""You can...see the dripping of hate off them,"" the source said, describing the way ""liberal"" employees behave around their outspoken conservative colleagues.   The tense atmosphere highlights how even famously liberal Silicon Valley has become sucked into the vortex of America's chaotic national politics, as companies like Facebook grapple with their political role and influence on the public stage and within the workplace.   ""Anyone who says there's not a liberal bias here is either lying, or just so blinded by their political views they can't see the bias,"" the source said.   The internal Facebook group, ""FB'ers for Political Diversity,"" was founded by Brian Amerige, a senior engineer, following a post last week decrying what he views as the company's ""intolerant"" liberal culture. (The existence of the group  was first reported on Tuesday by The New York Times.)   Employees who view the group are greeted with a banner featuring apparent quotes from conservative Facebook employees, including ""They say that every opinion is welcome, but it's really not,"" ""It's not easy speaking out here, so props to you and good luck with the outrage mob,"" and ""I agree with you 100% but I'm too scared to show it publicly.""                                                                                               Amerige wrote in his initial post,  ""We Have a Problem with Political Diversity"":   ""We are a political monoculture that's intolerant of different views. We claim to welcome all perspectives, but are quick to attack—often in mobs—anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology. We throw labels that end in â*obeâ and â*istâ at each other, attacking each other's character rather than their ideas.""   As of Tuesday, the group now has more than 160 members. It includes both conservative and liberal employees who agree with its message, an employee said.   Discussions range from whether there's ""a socialist version of Atlas Shrugged,"" a libertarian-objectivist classic, to the definitions of hate speech.   And there ""meta"" discussions about the group itself and its aims: ""[There is] an external impression that we are ideologues in an echo chamber, pursuing a goal of remaking FB's culture in a way that pleases us,"" an employee wrote. ""I hope this group doesn't become a forum for constant arguments by people who adamantly disagree with each other,"" wrote an operations employee in another post.                                                                                               Amerige laid out a set of rules for the group early on, including: No personal attacks, including calling people racist for supporting a public figure that someone believes is racist; ""assumption of good faith is a prerequisite to participation,"" and ""no memes or straw men.""   Reached for comment, Facebook spokesperson Bertie Thomson referred Business Insider to a statement issued Tuesday: ""On Day 1 of Facebook's new hire orientation in Menlo Park, everyone hears from our Chief Diversity Officer about the importance of diversity and how to have respectful conversations with people who have different viewpoints.""   The Facebook employee, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told Business Insider that the political climate since the formation of the group has been ""positive,"" and ""a lot of people who you wouldn't expect to be conservative actually came and joined the group and actually came out as conservatives.""   More generally though, the person said that the majority of conservative Facebook employees feel uncomfortable disclosing their political stance to their more liberal coworkers. One trans employee said she found it harder to ""come out"" as conservative than as trans at Facebook, according to the source.   The Facebook employee also said conservatives at the company believe they can be fired more easily than others, citing ousted Oculus founder Palmer Luckey as an example: ""If you're conservative at Facebook, you're already walking on eggshells. You will get fired quicker than if you're a liberal in seconds.""                                                                                               The size of the group — roughly 160 employees — is a tiny proportion of Facebook's total headcount of more than 25,000. But the stance of its members illustrates a rift in the tech giant between its politically liberal majority and a minority of conservative employees who feel unable to speak freely.   ""There is diversity at Facebook with its employees, but there is definitely a lack of political diversity,"" another employee told Business Insider. ""As Mr Zuckerberg said to Congress on Capital Hill Facebook is located in an area that is left leaning. I would say that is an understatement.""   In July, more than a month before founding the FB'ers for Political Diversity"" group, Amerige spoke out against a mural in Facebook's new MPK21 building which says ""GENDER FREE,"" labeling it ""radical leftist art.""   ""Facebook is free to put up whatever art it wants, but I just want to register my frustration and frankly the disgust I feel every time I pass this,"" he wrote.   He criticized it as an attempt ""to wipe out the validity of gender as a concept,"" arguing that ""we do not make progress towards treating people as individuals by blanking out the existence of what makes us different from one another.""                                                                                               Posters promoting ""FB'ers for Political Diversity"" have since been stuck beneath it.  The ""GENDER FREE"" mural at Facebook's headquarters.ialvarock/Instagram  Amerige's post on Political Diversity — as well as his earlier criticism of the mural — drew condemnation from some colleagues.   ""This isn't nearly [as] interesting of a take as you think friendo. Being called out for behaving in a harmful way is part of learning how not to be harmful, if you take that as an personal attack rather than an opportunity, that's your problem,"" said a customer support specialist, criticising his initial response to the mural.   ""Political 'diversity' is not ipso facto good,"" said another software engineer. ""Politics is the study of power, and not all uses of power are good.""                                                                                               Others were more supportive. ""This is a really important note. Thank you for writing,"" wrote a software engineer, arguing the definition of ""tolerance"" has shifted. ""The culture that flows from this new 'tolerance' tends to be rather unkind, unforgiving, and ironically, intolerant (by the classic definition).""   Another employee added: ""'I disagree of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.' We need to channel Voltaire more in the company today. So many viewpoints are summarily dismissed as *ist/*obe because they are not understood.""   Silicon Valley, the heart of the American tech industry and has been fraught with allegations of bias in Trump's America.   In July 2017, Google found itself at the centre of a political firestorm after engineer James Damore wrote an internal post decrying what he characterised as ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber,"" in which he attacked the company's diversity efforts. Some conservatives also allege that social media firms are deliberately silencing and censoring non-liberal voices on their platforms.   Facebook has grappled with how to approach dissent by conservative employees before.  As Business Insider previously reported in 2017, a group called ""Facebook Anon"" where employees could chat anonymously morphed into a hub for conservative, Trump-supporting employees during the 2016 election.

Samantha Lee / Business Insider                                      Facebook is making a bigger bet on Watch and plans to crank up the number of ads that appear in videos.   On Wednesday, the social network rolled out Watch globally. Up until now, Facebook tested Watch in the US only as  part of a bigger bet to enlist creators and publishers to make content that consumers will habitually watch on the platform.   As part of the expansion, publishers can now access a hub called Creator Studio, which allows them to manage their video inventory and access analytics about their videos, including a new metric that specifically measures audience retention.   Watch has  slowly evolved in the US over the past few months to include more videos from Pages that are monetized through mid-roll and pre-roll ads. While ad loads are small, some publishers are starting to see revenue potential in Watch, especially with the ability to sell their own inventory.   According to Facebook, 50 million people in the US visit the Watch tab every month to watch videos for at least one minute.   ""It's not an insane ad load to where it would drive users away, but if you've watched two or three minutes of video, we hope in the Watch environment that you're going to stay on what's next,"" Ken Blom, VP of branded distribution at BuzzFeed, told Business Insider recently. ""Facebook will talk about 'intentionality' as the metric that they think about for Watch.""   Similar to the gradual rollout in the US, videos from any international Pages are now eligible to show up in Watch, regardless of whether it's a show or a video clip.   Creators in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia can set up ad breaks to make money off of their videos. The international ad break program will expand to 21 additional countries and languages in September including Argentina, France, Spain, Thailand, and Peru.   Facebook claims that 70% of mid-roll ads are viewed to completion and offers publishers an auto-insertion tool that can automatically detect the best place to plug an ad into a video. Publishers can also control ad breaks manually. Creators keep 55% of ad revenue while Facebook keeps the other 45%.                                                                                   To be eligible for ad breaks, publishers need to create three-minute videos that have collectively racked up 30,000 one-minute views over the past two months. They also need to have Pages with  at least 10,000 followers.  Within Creator Studio, publishers can see stats like:  The Facebook Watch dashboard                                            Facebook                                      ",0.0,0.946,0.054,0.9685

Facebook's Head of Video Fidji Simo said Watch was gaining real momentum in a crowded marketplace because it was built on the notion that watching videos could be a social activity.   ""Every month more than 50 million people in the U.S. come to watch videos for at least a minute on Watch, and total time spent watching video on Facebook Watch has increased by 14 times since the start of 2018,"" she told reporters.   ""With Watch ... you can have a two-way conversation about the content with friends, other fans or even the creatives themselves.""   Facebook said eligible creators would be able to make money from their videos using its Ad Breaks service in Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand as well as the United States from Thursday, with many more countries set to follow.   Simo said publishers were making ""meaningful revenues"" from its automated video advertising system on the platform, which has featured shows such as beauty mogul Huda Kattan's ""Huda Boss"" and live ""Major League Baseball"" games.   ""We know it's been a long road but we've worked hard to ensure that the Ad Breaks experience is a good one for both our partners and our community,"" she said.   Ad revenue will be split 55 percent for the content creator and 45 percent for Facebook, the same ratio as in the United States, Simo said.   Publishers need to have created three-minute videos that have generated more than 30,000 one-minute views in total over the past two months and must have 10,000 followers to participate in Ad Breaks, Facebook said.   Simo said Facebook was working on a variety of other options for creators to make money, such as branded content and the ability for fans to directly support their favorite creators through subscriptions.   ""(Fan subscription) is something that is rolled out to a few creators now, but we are planning on expanding that program soon,"" she said.

The Advertising Standards Association questioned claims that Natural Cycles is a ""highly accurate contraceptive app."" The app…",2018-08-29 09:12:20,business-insider,Birth control app Natural Cycles is in trouble after misleading people with claims it is 'highly accurate',https://www.businessinsider.com/natural-cycles-facebook-ad-banned-after-featuring-misleading-claim-2018-8,https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a0b0c6635876ebf438b59ee-1536-768.jpg,"createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');Natural Cycles.Natural Cycles/Facebook   Natural Cycles, which has just been greenlit by the Food and Drug Administration to launch in the US, claims it can provide by protection-free birth control by tracking a woman's menstrual cycle through her body temperature.   Using an algorithm developed by the company, the app then shows the user whether she is either on a fertile day or a non-fertile day, in which case it claims it is safe to have unprotected sex. The app costs Â£39.99 ($51.50) a year or Â£5.99 ($7.71) a month, and comes with a thermometer.   The ASA investigated a paid-for Natural Cycles ad on Facebook in July 2017, which claimed: ""Natural Cycles is a highly accurate, certified, contraceptive app that adapts to every woman's unique menstrual cycle. Sign up to get to know your body and prevent pregnancies naturally.""   The ASA found that Natural Cycles had exaggerated the app's ""typical-use"" failure rate — i.e. how often it fails when someone doesn't use it 100% correctly, as is often the case with contraceptives.   Natural Cycles told the ASA that clinical trials showed it was 93% effective with typical use, but the ASA's investigation found that this figure was exaggerated, and a more realistic figure was 91.7%. It also found that Natural Cycles requires far more input from the user than other contraception methods, and that only 9.6% of inputted cycles in the app could be considered ""perfect-use.""  Natural Cycles' co-founder and CTO Elina Berglund Scherwitzl.Courtesy of Natural Cycles  ""We considered that in isolation, the claim 'clinically tested alternative to birth control methods' was unlikely to mislead. However, when presented alongside the accompanying claim 'Highly accurate contraceptive app', it further contributed to the impression that the app was a precise and reliable method of preventing pregnancies which could be used in place of other established birth control methods,"" the ruling concluded.   ""Because the evidence did not demonstrate that in typical-use it was 'highly accurate' and because it was significantly less effective than the most reliable birth control methods, we considered that in the context of the ad the claim was likely to mislead.""                                                                                   The ASA banned the ad from appearing on Facebook and warned Natural Cycles not to say that the app was a highly accurate method of contraception, or to exaggerate its efficacy in preventing pregnancies.   A Natural Cycles spokeswoman told Business Insider that the ASA probe triggered an internal investigation and adverts now undergo a strict approval process.   ""We respect the outcome of the investigation by the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) into one Facebook advertisement, which ran for approximately 4 weeks in mid-2017. The investigation was initiated nearly 12 months ago and the advertisement was removed as soon as we were notified of the complaint,"" she added.   This is not the only time an investigation has called the efficacy of Natural Cycles as a contraceptive into question.  The company is under investigation in Sweden after a hospital reported that 37 of 668 female patients who sought an abortion between September and December 2017 had been using the app.   ",0.043,0.864,0.093,0.9789

Amerige did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.   Silicon Valley, the heart of the American tech industry, is largely liberal, and has been fraught with allegations of bias in Trump's America.

TheMaven                                      Serial entrepreneur James Heckman wants to create a healthy alternative outside of Facebook for small publishers — and is making cuts to do so.   In March, Maven  announced plans to acquire Say Media. The company also acquired HubPages in January and said that the combination of Maven, Say Media and HubPages ""will bring together former competitors to create a dominant platform for professional, independent publishers,"" according to a press release.   Maven offers publishers a platform that reaches more than 90 million monthly readers and includes 300 channels with 6,000 writers, the company says.   As part of the transition to becoming a single company, Say Media laid off 17 staffers across roles in its creative studio, development, engineering, sales and general and administrative departments two weeks ago. The company's Toronto and London offices have closed and some of the company will operate out of Maven's office in Seattle.   Say Media also has also let got of some employees in its New York, San Francisco and Portland offices.   ""All three companies do the same thing,"" Heckman told Business Insider. ""It would be really irresponsible for us to not finish the merger as planned. It's a shame on a personal basis but obviously it's an exciting move for the company to get to profitability.""   Maven says the cuts shave $5 million off of operating costs and the firm is on track to hit its previous revenue goal of a $30 million run rate this year. Matt Sanchez, CEO and founder of Say Media, will help in the transition but is leaving the company. Heckman expects for the Say Media deal to close in September.   Sanchez founded a video advertising company called VideoEgg in 2005 that was renamed Say Media in 2010 after acquiring ad network Six Apart. Say Media owned media brands like xoJane, ReadWrite and Remodelista for a few years before selling them off in 2014 to focus solely on providing technology for publishers.   According to one source, Say Media team leads were notified to make decisions about ""major"" staff cuts within 24 to 48 hours.                                                                                               At the time of the acquisition in March, it seemed like Sanchez would be included in Maven's new leadership, which included being featured in a 7-minute video that Maven distributed to explain how the coalition would work.    On April 6, Say Media employees received a memo written from Heckman sent via Sanchez's email address detailing how the three companies would work together. The bottom of the email listed bios on 18 of Maven's leadership team at the time — including Sanchez.   ""The destruction of an online news and information ecosystem that took two decades to build has created a vacuum, and an opportunity as big as Facebook's forfeiture of the news space,"" he wrote. ""So it makes sense our three founding teams agreed to join hands and align complementary skill sets to restore sustainability by fairly empowering independent, professional content creators — 'mavens.' To ensure success, it's critical we move forward as one, and without hesitation. Success means fair rewards for everyone: advertisers, publishers, consumers, all of you as well as investors.""   He went on to explain Maven's mission to provide a unified publishing platform, ad-tech stack and sales operations for independent publishers. The idea is to create an alternative to the duopoly of Facebook and Google that often controls how publishers distribute content and sell ads.                                                                                               ""There's an extraordinary, urgent need to solve for independent publisher sustainability,"" Heckman wrote. ""Frankly, we're at ground zero of the biggest cultural and news shift of our era, including the impact of fake news, fake traffic, election fraud, destroyed livelihoods, data theft, broken promises and Silicon Valley executives playing God on lots of levels. We're in position now to help in a meaningful way.""   Maven's leadership team now consists of Heckman as CEO and member of the board; president and executive chair of the board Josh Jacobs; chief operating officer and former HubPages CEO/founder Paul Edmondson; CMO Michelle Panzer, formerly Say Media's vp of global marketing and brand development; and chief product officer Ben Trott, formerly Say Media's vp of engineering.

Facebook's share price hasn't fully recovered from its  single-day market cap loss of $150 billion in July. Now, the burden falls on the social network to win back the confidence of its users. A study of US consumers shows that Facebook has its work cut out for it, however.   As this  chart from Statista shows, the Cambridge Analytica scandal seems to have resulted in a broader loss of user trust in social media platforms, which would include the likes of Twitter, as well. Only 27% of US consumers surveyed said they felt confident that their data is kept secure by social media companies, and 37% saying they didn't.   For comparison, 53% said they trusted banking companies to safeguard their information, while only 13% said they didn't.  createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');                                            Shayanne Gal/Business Insider                                      ",0.081,0.768,0.151,0.9246

Facebook wants to help maximize how publishers pitch content to users on the platform, according to Facebook news team product manager, Mollie Vandor.   Here's why Facebook is focusing on driving traffic referrals:   The tool is the latest step that builds on the social giant's efforts to combat declining news readers, which hurts Facebook's ability to collect data for ad targeting. The social platform in July  debuted its first slate of funded news shows in its long-form video section Watch, with partners including ATTN., Quartz, and Mic.   These news shows could help supplement the news content Facebook users are already consuming through news links on the platform, potentially making Facebook a stickier news consumption platform.

It's also publicly promising to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 75% over the same timeframe, using 2017 as a base year.   The two goals are a significant new commitment towards green energy for Facebook, building on previous targets and giving it new concrete, measurable goals to work towards.   Tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple, consume extraordinary quantities of electricity to power their global networks of data centres and infrastructure.   These have the capacity to significantly contribute to global greenhouse emissions — though most of the major tech firms have made pledges towards renewable energy with varying levels of specificity.   In a 2017 report assessing the environmental credentials of tech firms, Greenpeace scored Apple most highly — hailing it as ""among the most aggressive in the sector in its efforts to power its online platform with renewable energy.""   Facebook also got an A-grade, with Greenpeace commending it: ""Facebook was the first major internet company to commit to be 100% renewably powered and continues to play a leadership role within the sector. Showing strong transparency and a track record of its five latest data centers sighted in locations that allowed them to be renewably powered.""   Google is ""improving its renewable energy deployment in new markets to keep pace with its rapid growth,"" Greenpeace said, but it ""still has significant room to improve in regards to transparency.""   Facebook previously set itself a goal of 25% renewables by 2015, and 50% by 2018 after that.

Early adopters are already putting the device though its paces. But one early adopter's review, in particular, is getting a lot of attention.   Palmer Luckey, the creator of the Oculus virtual reality headset, published a review on his website this week titled, ""Magic Leap is a Tragic Heap.""   In case the title didn't make it clear, Luckey is no fan of the Magic Leap One — he calls the device, ""a tragedy in the classical sense...less of a functional developer kit and more of a flashy hype vehicle that almost nobody can actually use in a meaningful way.""  The entire Magic Leap One setup: A small computer (left), the headset (middle), and controller (right).Magic Leap  OK, so Luckey obviously has a dog in this fight. As the creator of the Oculus VR headset, Luckey might well have a motivation (conscious or not) in tearing down a product that threatens the Oculus' position as the pre-eminent headset for the new era of virtual and mixed reality.   And it's worth remembering that early versions of the Oculus headset had many flaws and rough edges, including a propensity to give some people motion sickness.   Still, with those caveats in mind, it's worth considering the specific criticisms Luckey cites in his review:   Luckey's review apparently caused a stir at Magic Leap headquarters, as CEO Rony Abovitz tweeted a series of oblique references to the ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" show that seemingly paint Luckey as a ""bitter, angry, banished"" troublemaker — a reference to his dismissal from Facebook following a political donation controversy, and subsequent exit from the virtual and augmented reality business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Luckey joined Facebook in 2014 after the social networking company acquired Oculus for $2 billion. Since his  unceremonious departure from Facebook in March 2017, Luckey has gone on to found  a new company focused on developing military/defense projects.  Luckey isn't the only one with a less-than-positive outlook after using Magic Leap One.   When tech publications got an early look at the device earlier this month,  many reviews were similarly unflattering. Investors, too, are  cooling on the imminent prospects of augmented reality headsets— but, even after $2.3 billion in capital, Magic Leap is still  open to raising more funding.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau                                      Facebook's recent decision to clamp down on how brands can and can't use third party data for ad targeting is causing a boom in legal work at agencies.   As Facebook continues to wind down Partner Categories — an ad product which allowed big brands to access third-party data like household income and loyalty programs from companies like Oracle and Acxiom to deliver ads, agencies are shifting gears.   Advertisers now have the option to tap into a Facebook program dubbed Custom Audiences, which still lets them work with third parties data companies but removes Facebook's involvement in helping advertisers craft audiences.   In other words, when it comes to data, Facebook is dumping any and all consumer protection responsibilities onto marketers.   As a result, brands and data brokers now  work together to create their own contracts, which are turning out to include lengthy and sometimes muddy terms and conditions, according to agencies.   In interviews with six agencies for this story, several execs agreed that Facebook's new guidelines around third-party data are an important — if not necessary — step for the company as it continues to seal up its platform against possible data mishaps and privacy issues for advertisers.   The heat has been on Facebook over the past year to get its ad targeting policies right, following the Cambridge Analytica mess, accusations of Russian election meddling, as well as the rollout of European Union's  General Data Protection Regulation.  Some see Facebook's decision to get rid of Partner Categories as a way to protect consumers. Others see it as a way for the social networking giants to assert more control of advertising on its platform while dodging responsibility.   Besides the new moves to rework its relationships with third parties, Facebook has also  rolled out transparency tools and eliminated  thousands of discriminatory ad targeting options for advertisers, which are collectively geared at cleaning up the platform for advertisers by putting new controls in place.                                                                                   ""Facebook has forced all our hands but I think it creates a good opportunity in some ways to talk to clients about how to think more deliberately about how they buy,"" said Jon Taylor, SVP of global data strategy at Essence. ""Going through that process is a little cumbersome because you have to do contracts — while that may seem like a drag, [it] actually forces the marketer to watch a lot more closely what they're buying.""                                              Minerva Studio/Shutterstock                                      While these changes may be making advertisers more aware of what they are actually buying on Facebook, the transition from Partner Categories to Custom Audiences has been rocky for some, particularly with figuring out how liability for data breaks down between parties.   ""Selecting a segment from an audience marketplace and testing it online is quite different then putting pen to paper with a direct seller, making commitments and taking on more direct liability,"" Taylor said.   Plus, there are a sprawling number of ways that advertisers use data on Facebook that slightly overlap with each other depending on the use case that need to be ironed out in contracts:   That's led to one big unanswered question that agencies are mulling as they negotiate new contracts and deals: 'Who is liable for third-party data on Facebook if Facebook is not?'                                                                                   ""It is this phenomenal game of hot potato where everybody in the space is trying to push the potential liability to somebody else,"" said Jeff Ratner, chief media officer at iCrossing.   ""We've spent a lot of time looking at terms and understanding where that liability may or may not rest. As an agency, even when we're working with clients' first-party data, we're saying to the client, 'you [have to] give us your customer base, you have to validate that the information is usable in the exact use that we're proposing.'""  Brands are juggling contracts with data brokers.                                            Carl Court/Getty Images                                      On August 15, Facebook stopped offering advertisers the ability to create audiences using third-party data within its platform. Advertisers that created third-party audiences before then can continue to run un-edited campaigns through October 1 when Facebook will officially turn off the spigot to the program and stop delivering campaigns.   As part of the shift, Facebook outlined  the terms and conditions for Custom Audiences in May. Since then, agencies and data companies have spent hours poring over the document to understand what exactly they are liable for.                                                                                   ""I've had endless conversations with our legal department in the last two months,"" said Anita Walsh, director of social strategy at Horizon Media. ""There are definite nuances around who owns the ad account, for example. Is it the client or the agency on behalf of the client?""   According to Facebook spokeswoman, ""an agency acting on behalf of an advertiser must comply with our Custom Audience Terms. Those terms also require that anyone uploading a Custom Audience on behalf of an advertiser must have the authority as agent to the advertiser to disclose and use the data on the advertiser's behalf and will bind the advertiser to the terms.""   Facebook acknowledged that some marketers found the terms difficult to understand and has clarified one part of it. Last Wednesday, the terms and conditions were updated with additional information about how brands can work with agencies to run campaigns.   Previously, the terms said that advertisers could not sell or transfer their Custom Audiences. The update clarifies that marketers can ""independently work with partners off our platform to create Custom Audiences, as long as they have the necessary rights and permissions to do so.""  Facebook ad manager                                            Facebook                                      ""Advertisers routinely work with agencies and data providers to develop and manage their ad targeting audiences,"" Facebook  wrote in a blog. ""For example, data providers and agencies create, upload and then share certain Custom Audiences on behalf of advertisers. So we're clarifying our terms to make it clear that advertisers can do this.""                                                                                   According to Horizon Media's Walsh, the high-level rationale behind the changes were clearly communicated from Facebook. But the actual process of switching between Partner Categories to Custom Audiences has been ""a bit challenging.""   ""The concepts were well communicated and I think everybody understood the reasoning, but the detail and the actuality of how to implement the replacement or new process going forward took a little longer than everyone would have hoped and went to the wire,"" she said. ""The terms and conditions are long and that is one of the elements that is most confusing currently — ensuring that we as buyers who are deeply trained in buying Facebook ads are equally as trained in what we can and cannot accept.""   ""We have become great friends with our legal department over the last two months.""   Without a direct spigot into Facebook's platform, Cliff Atkinson, RPA's svp and executive director, said that data providers are actively pitching agencies. Based on those pitches, which walk advertisers through how they collect data, Atkinson believes that data providers are liable for third-party data — though he said that the discussions are still early.   ""It definitely created a shift in how we work with data providers moving forward,"" he said. ""They are almost seen as on equal footing as our vendors or media partners now — we are doing more direct deals with them.""  Acxiom CEO Scott Howe                                            John Lamparski/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York                                      Facebook's US partners for Custom Audiences are Acxiom, Oracle, and Experian. All three companies either declined to comment on the record or did not respond to press queries for this article.                                                                                   ""These data providers are stepping up — they're reaching out and asking to have meetings, to present their offerings in a different way,"" Atkinson said. ""They know that the availability of their data on other platforms is no longer available and they're losing out on that revenue coming in. They need to do some work and speak to agencies directly about the advantages of using their data. Once you see multiple data providers reach out, you want to get a clear understanding of what differentiates their data versus one of their competitors.""   Essence's Taylor agreed that data providers are ultimately responsible for data used in campaigns. ""Whatever is in that agreement between the marketer and the data provider is the backstop,"" he said.   Third-party data has always been murky and hard for advertisers to understand. Now Facebook is revealing exactly how much brands pay to access it, which several agencies said has caused sticker shock from clients.   Previously, a line within Facebook Ads Manager showed marketers that purchased Partner Categories a blended rate for data costs from its partnerships with providers. The language did not disclose the exact percentage that advertisers paid for data but said that up to 15% of spend went towards data costs.   Now under Custom Audiences, the cost of data is worked out between advertisers and providers ahead of time in contracts and is shown as a line item in invoices, breaking down the exact percentage that advertisers pay for data-related fees.  Advertisers are learning how much data really costs.                                            REUTERS/Gary Cameron                                      The move opens up transparency around fees. But it's also causing brands to wonder if paying for third-party data is worth it.                                                                                   At 15%, a million-dollar campaign would total $150,000 in data fees, for example.   ""There is certainly a very warranted discussion if we — the brand — are willing to pay X percent of X CPM on any data set,"" Horizon Media's Walsh said. ""[We're] doing a lot of tests and learning approaches to learn if the results will pay back in upfront investments in third-party data.""   To be clear, lots of advertisers don't even use third-party data in the first place and either use first-party stats or rely on Facebook's own powerful targeting tools to do the heavy lifting.   Direct-to-consumer brands and retailers collect data straight from their shoppers while automakers, CPG brands and entertainment marketers are some of the biggest spenders of third-party data because they don't have direct relationships with their customers.   ""We stress and focus on first-party data a lot,"" said RPA's Atkinson. ""We've seen that first-party data outperforms third-party data.""                                                                                   Before August 15 when Partner Categories ended, ""a fairly high percentage"" of Horizon Media's clients used third-party data. ""That percentage has certainly dropped,"" Walsh said. ""It may not drop forever and it's a significant testing period, but it's very likely to change across the board now that we see this line-itemed cost and how the new user flow works.""   And with more scrutiny on data under laws like GDPR and looming privacy laws  in California and elsewhere in the US, several agencies stressed that they're pushing brands to move away from relying on third-party data.   ""What clients should be thinking about [is] ensuring that the data was acquired rightfully and that customer consent was given,"" said Guillaume Lelait, CEO of Fetch US. ""Third-party data is perceived a little murky by some clients with no clear transparency of how it was acquired, so we are educating them on the right steps to take to ensure this is compliant.""

Getty                                       The probe is being closely watched in Europe amid mounting concerns over leaks of data on tens of millions of Facebook users, as well as the extensive use of targeted ads by foreign powers seeking to influence elections in the United States.   The Federal Cartel Office objects in particular to how Facebook acquires data on people from third-party apps - including its own WhatsApp and Instagram services - and its online tracking of people who aren't even members.   ""We are conscious that this should, and must, go quickly,"" cartel office President Andreas Mundt told a news conference on Monday, adding that he hoped to take ""first steps"" this year. He declined to elaborate.   The German probe is not expected to end in fines for Facebook, in contrast to European Union probes into Google that have ended in multi-billion-dollar penalties, most recently over the preinstallation of its apps on Android smartphones.   Sources familiar with the matter say, however, that the cartel office could require Facebook to take action to address its concerns if the company fails to do so voluntarily.   Facebook responded earlier this year to the cartel office's request for information, and the authority was reviewing whether new features - such as a ""clear history"" option announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in May - would address its concerns.   ""We need to establish whether this affects our investigation and addresses our concerns,"" Mundt said.   Separately, Mundt confirmed comments he made in a newspaper interview earlier this month that he may launch an investigation into the e-commerce industry under new powers that enable the cartel office to launch sector-wide probes.                                                               The focus would be on so-called ""hybrid"" platforms such as U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon that sell their own products and services, but that also host third-party traders.   ""Our question is: what is the relationship between the platform, which itself is a very powerful trader, and the traders who use the platform?"" said Mundt. He added that Amazon was the best-known of the e-commerce platforms but his interest in the matter extended to other players.   The cartel office would not be looking at suspected tax evasion by third-party traders on e-commerce platforms - an issue that Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has vowed to tackle - saying this was a matter for economic policy makers.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images                                       Even so, Facebook and its family of apps take up an astonishing amount of the time people spend on their smartphones.   According to new data from app-analysis firm Apptopia seen by Business Insider, time spent in Facebook's apps make up almost a third of the all the time people spend on the 100 most popular apps across Apple's iOS and Google's Android mobile operating systems.   In other words, of every 100 minutes spent in the world's most popular apps, 32 of those are gobbled up by Facebook — whether that's in Facebook itself, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, or its other apps.   The data highlights how deeply Facebook has entrenched itself into people's digital lives, and the extent to which it has managed to dominate the mobile landscape, despite not building core platforms like Apple and Google.                                              Samantha Lee/Business Insider                                      Facebook even outstrips Google, according to Apptopia's data. Time spent in Google's apps — including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps — takes up 22% of the time spent in the top 100 apps across iOS and Android.   When the scope is widened to encompass the top 500 most popular apps, Facebook's and Google's share drops slightly, though they still take up an extraordinarily large amount of time, 20% and 14%, respectively.   Overall, between the start of May and the end of July, users spent a cumulative 300 billion hours on Facebook's apps, and 118 billion in Google's.                                                                                                           The top 10 apps, in terms of time spent, are, in order:   The data is worldwide, though it excludes third-party app stores, including in China (where Google's first-party app store, Google Play, is not available). ""We combine session data from both the app side and consumer side for our learning set, which our data science team then creates estimation models with,"" AppTopia communications lead Adam Blacker said in an email.   ""From the app side, more than 250,000 mobile app developer accounts are connected to Apptopia. From the consumer side, our SDK partner provides us with panel data from hundreds of millions of devices.""   The findings also highlight the success of Facebook's aggressive acquisition and spin-out strategy. Over the past few years, it has snapped up potential competitors and up-and-coming startups left, right, and center, while also spinning out core Facebook functions (Messenger, Local) into standalone apps.   Instagram, which it bought for a relatively paltry $1 billion in 2012,  is now worth an estimated $100 billion and has a whopping 1 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp, which it picked up for a more substantial $19 billion, in 2014, took up 85 billion hours of users' time alone in the three-month period measured by Apptopia.                                                                                                           Asked outright if he thought he had a monopoly at the Senate hearing, Zuckerberg responded to laughter that ""it certainly doesn't feel like that to me."" But regardless of whether Facebook's dominance technically qualifies as one, it clearly now owns an unprecedented mindshare of the worldwide app market.  Work at Facebook? Got a tip?

Apart from the banned accounts, Facebook said it had removed 46 Pages and 12 accounts for engaging in coordinated ""inauthentic"" behavior on Facebook.

British politicians condemned the social network  for undermining international aid efforts, and the company has admitted it was  too slow to act against misinformation.

REUTERS/Chris Donovan/File Photo                                       The Saudi government announced on August 7 that it would recall students on government grants or scholarships from Canada. Since then, students have been trying to sell all their belongings online and in garage sales — from pots and pans to chairs to cars.   The Ummah Mosque and community center in Halifax, Nova Scotia, held two garage sales on August 12 and August 17 to help students to help the students sell their belongings.   Imam Abdullah Yousri, who runs the mosque, said he decided to hold the sales when he saw so many students were trying to get rid of their stuff online.   He told Business Insider: ""It came to my attention that they are selling their belongings on social media groups with very low prices because they are in rush.   ""So I thought it would be a great cause to help them selling their belongings with reasonable prices if we arrange a yard sale for them beside the Mosque.""   He said that the sale was open to ""anybody."" He added  on the Facebook event page for one of the garage sales: ""Such garage sale is open for all the community but especially our Saudi student brethren to assist them in the sale of their belongings.""   ""They don't have much choice,"" he said. ""They just started selling their belongings to prepare for leaving.""  Here's what the first garage sale looked like.    It was so successful that the mosque  held a second one for cars later that week. The cars on sale that day included 2010 Dodge Journey and a 2010 Hyundai Sonata, according to a Facebook Marketplace ad for the event.                                                                                   Those selling their cars online also revealed their sadness at having to part with their vehicles.   One student selling a 2018 Nissan Rogue S on Facebook in Ontario said he was ""an unfortunate Saudi Student who is been forced to leave Canada due to the clash with Saudi Arabia.""   ""When I have purchased this car, it meant to be my everlasting but sometimes you have no option. It is still like-new brand car, everything is awesome and perfect,"" he added. ""I have oil sprayed it this summer to be ready for the winter, but sadly I won't even stay for the fall!""   Elsewhere, many students are selling tables, televisions, chairs, and shelves on Facebook Marketplace, while others are using Kijiji, a Canadian buy-and-sell website, to get rid of  strollers and mattresses.

In response, Saudi Arabia expelled the Canadian ambassador, frozen all new investment, and canceled all flights to Toronto.   Neither country is willing to back down, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying on Thursday tha t his government is continuing to ""engage diplomatically"" with Saudi Arabia, but that he is ""concerned"" after news broke that  a Saudi woman is facing a death sentence for her political activism.   Canadian universities have been trying to support their Saudi students in wake of the new policy. Five universities said on Wednesday that the Saudi trainee doctors enrolled in their programs had been granted an extra three weeks in the country, and can stay until September 22, according to Reuters.   The University of Toronto's vice-provost for international student experience, Joseph Wong,  also said in a statement: ""This is a very stressful time for these students.

Netflix                                       That was basically the proposal put forward this week by Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's opposition party and Prime Minister Theresa May's most powerful adversary.   Speaking to an audience of some of the UK's most influential media executives, Corbyn posited the idea of creating a British Digital Corporation, or BDC. If that acronym has a familiar ring, you'd be right.   Under his vision, the BDC would effectively be a sister organisation to the BBC, a sort of digital sidekick to Britain's 96-year-old national broadcaster, known affectionately as Auntie.   Like the BBC, the BDC would be funded and owned by the British public. The BBC collects its money through the TV licence, a levy on UK households that generates around Â£3.8 billion ($4.9 billion) in revenue a year for the corporation.   Corbyn was a little woolly on the detail, and his suggestions prompted people to speculate that he wants to create a nationalised Facebook, without all the nasty fake news and data misuse, where users can vote on TV shows they want to be made.   Below is the plan in his own words, taken from his speech at the Edinburgh International Television Festival in Scotland. You can watch the speech in full here. Corbyn said:   ""A BDC could use all of our best minds, the latest technology and our existing public assets not only to deliver information and entertainment to rival Netflix and Amazon but also to harness data for the public good.   ""A BDC could develop new technology for online decision making and audience-led commissioning of programmes and even a public social media platform with real privacy and public control over the data that is making Facebook and others so rich.                                                                                               ""It could become the access point for public knowledge, information and content currently held in the BBC archives, the British Library and the British Museum. Imagine an expanded iPlayer giving universal access to licence fee payers for a product that could rival Netflix and Amazon. It would probably sell pretty well overseas as well.""   Delegates who spoke to Business Insider after the speech concluded it was a radical, but ultimately unworkable and unnecessary plan. Others just ridiculed it.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.                                            Getty                                      Brent Hoberman, the founder of lastminute.com and a prominent UK tech investor, tweeted: ""Who is advising these people?!!?""  Damian Collins, the Conservative politician in charge of the committee of lawmakers that held Facebook to account over the Cambridge Analytica crisis, was equally scathing. He said it would be a ""British Digital Leyland""— a reference to British Leyland, which in 1968 amalgamated several carmakers into one company in one of the biggest disasters in the history of nationalisation.                                                                                               Alison Kirkham, a senior figure at the BBC, raised an even more existential question about Corbyn's vision. She told me that the British Digital Corporation overlooks an organisation already doing the very things he wants to achieve — the BBC.   Don't forget, the BBC basically invented the online video player with iPlayer in 2007. Indeed, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once said: ""The iPlayer really blazed the trail. That was long before Netflix and really got people used to this idea of on-demand viewing.""   And as far as creating social conversation, connecting people, audience-led commissioning, and broadening horizons, are concerned, well the BBC has been doing that since it was invented in 1922.   Just look at radio phone-ins, giant shared viewing experiences like ""Strictly Come Dancing"" (or ""Dancing With the Stars"" as it is known in the US), TV shows being axed or supercharged based on ratings, and the BBC's partnerships with organisations like The Open University. All of which can be accessed online.   ""There seems to be a lack of understanding that the BBC is already a very digital organisation,"" Kirkham, the BBC's controller of factual commissioning said.                                                                                               ""It's a real asset that the digital offer is an integral part of the broader BBC offer. I'm not sure it would serve audiences, I'm not sure it would make economic sense, to peel the two away and create two separate organisations.""   Corbyn certainly achieved his aim of getting people talking to ""generate some new thinking."" Like all radical ideas, however, it appears to have raised more questions than answers.

In a post on Facebook, chief product officer Chris Cox welcomed Lucio aboard.   ""Facebook's story is at an inflection point,"" Cox wrote. ""We have never faced bigger challenges, and we have never had more opportunities to have a positive impact on the world — in our families, our friendships, our communities, and our democracy — by improving our products at their core, and then by telling the story outside that we all know to be true inside.""   Facebook hasn't had a great year, it's fair to say. It's been battered by successive crises, from the spread of Russian propaganda to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, to the ongoing furors over the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation on the service.   The company's executives have found themselves on the defensive, and the company has tried to signal contrition to its users with ad campaigns declaring that ""fake news is not your friend."" One of Lucio's challenges, then, will be to try and repair its ailing image with the public.   Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg also posted about Lucio's hire, writing:   ""Antonio has a lot of experience leading marketing for major brands like HP and Visa - and he's been recognized for both his talents and commitment to diversity.

Paul Ceglia, 45, a wood pellet salesman from Wellsville in upstate New York, had been missing since March 2015, when he removed his electronic ankle bracelet and disappeared with his wife, two children and a dog.   Ceglia fled less than two months before his scheduled trial in Manhattan federal court on mail fraud and wire fraud charges, over his alleged forging of documents to extort Facebook and Zuckerberg.   In a letter to U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick, prosecutors said Ceglia was arrested in Ecuador on Thursday morning and is expected to appear by Friday in a court in Quito, the country's capital.   Prosecutors said they will update Broderick as they learn more about Ceglia's extradition proceedings.   The criminal case arose from Ceglia's conduct related to a 2010 civil lawsuit he had filed against Zuckerberg.   Ceglia claimed that Zuckerberg had, while a student at Harvard University, signed a 2003 contract giving him half of a planned social networking website that later became Facebook.   U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara in Buffalo dismissed Ceglia's lawsuit after another judge said the contract was doctored.   The market value of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook is now close to $500 billion, and Forbes magazine said Zuckerberg's own net worth is about $64.8 billion.                                                               Ceglia was criminally charged in November 2012. News of his arrest was earlier reported by WGRZ television in Buffalo, about 85 miles (137 km) northwest of Wellsville.   Robert Ross Fogg, a lawyer for Ceglia in the criminal case, in a Thursday phone interview said he was ""relieved"" that Ceglia appeared to have been located without incident, and was ""hoping that he and his family are safe.""   He also said there remained a ""strong case"" for Ceglia's defense, and that Ceglia's alleged agreement with Zuckerberg ""truly was a contract.""   Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   The case is U.S. v. Ceglia, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00876.

""We've updated U.S. lawmakers and law enforcement about the results of our investigation,"" Walker said in his post, ""including its relation to political content in the United States.""   The large tech companies have been under pressure to safeguard their sites from future attempts by foreign agents to mislead the public, cause chaos or sway elections. It is believed that Russia used the big social networks to try and affect the 2016 US presidential election.   While all this sounds scary, the sites hardly seemed very influential. Walker wrote that the total number of views acquired by the 42 Russian-connected channels was 1,800. The videos available on the IRIB-linked channels acquired a total of 13,466 views. Videos posted to YouTube by news groups, such as CNN and Fox, frequently accumulate views in the hundreds of thousands.   The news about the purged channels comes a day after  Facebook announced that it had suspended hundreds of accounts it said were linked to the governments of Russia and Iran.   Both Google and Facebook were acting on information supplied by web security company, FireEye. According to Walker's post, some of the sites removed from YouTube were connected to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Others were linked to the Internet Research Agency, allegedly a front for Russia's web trolls.   After receiving the tipoff from FireEye, Walker said Google launched its own investigation.

Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president for global affairs,  wrote that 39 channels with ties to Iran and 42 connected to Russia were booted from the video-sharing service.   ""We've updated U.S. lawmakers and law enforcement about the results of our investigation,"" Walker said in his post, ""including its relation to political content in the United States.""   The large tech companies have been under pressure to safeguard their sites from future attempts by foreign agents to mislead the public, cause chaos or sway elections. It is believed that Russia used the big social networks to try and affect the 2016 US presidential election.   While all this sounds scary, the sites hardly seemed very influential. Walker wrote that the total number of views acquired by the 42 Russian-connected channels was 1,800. The videos available on the IRIB-linked channels acquired a total of 13,466 views. Videos posted to YouTube by news groups, such as CNN and Fox, frequently accumulate views in the hundreds of thousands.   The news about the purged channels comes a day after  Facebook announced that it had suspended hundreds of accounts it said were linked to the governments of Russia and Iran.   Both Google and Facebook were acting on information supplied by web security company, FireEye. According to Walker's post, some of the sites removed from YouTube were connected to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Others were linked to the Internet Research Agency, allegedly a front for Russia's web trolls.   After receiving the tipoff from FireEye, Walker said Google launched its own investigation.

To be the first to know, please  click here.  Facebook is testing speech recognition technology — which would be a necessary part of any move into the smart speaker market — reports  TechCrunch.  createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');                                            Business Insider Intelligence                                      A video was discovered that showed that the company is testing a program called ""Aloha,"" which can recognize and transcribe speech. That same video includes references to ""Portal,"" the purported name of at least one of the rumored smart speakers that Facebook is reportedly developing.   This news would see to indicate that Facebook is putting together all of the ingredients necessary for a voice-activated smart speaker.   Facebook has been inching toward releasing a smart speaker for a number of months.Rumors initially  emerged last year that the social media giant was potentially looking to wade into the hardware market, but certain team heads within the company appeared  reticent to embrace the voice interface too fully and argued that it was immature and not ready for the role being proposed for it.   But the company has reportedly moved ahead with its efforts and developed two voice-powered smart speakers that it was planning to show off in May at its developer conference. These plans, though, were  scuttled by the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal.   Since then, the company has made  hardware hires and considered how best to proceed with the launch of its smart speakers, potentially looking to  international markets first. And now, the revelation of the Aloha voice interface is another key indicator that Facebook is preparing to move ahead with its smart speaker plans.   Facebook may be the dominant entity in social media, but it's never been a significant hardware player and could face a challenging path wading into this market. Its screen-equipped Portal smart speaker will  reportedly cost $499, higher than any competing devices from Apple, Google, or Amazon. And it won't have any track record to build upon, since Facebook hasn't offered any hardware or voice-based AI in the past.   It's also unclear who the target market for this smart speaker would be. Most of all, though, to convince those consumers who don't yet own a smart speaker to buy its Portal device, Facebook would need to overcome trust issues, which 41% of respondents to an  exclusive Business Insider Intelligence survey cited as the main reason they haven't bought a smart speaker yet.   Given the company's  trust issues, this will be another major hurdle to overcome if it looks to move into the consumer hardware market.  ",0.03,0.82,0.15,0.9946

Drew Angerer/Getty Images                                       The news was first reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed its removal to Business Insider. It's still available from the Google Play store on Android.   Onavo, an Israeli security firm acquired by Facebook in 2013, has long been the source of controversy.   Its flagship app, Onavo Protect, offers users a number of security features, including security alerts and access to a virtual private network (VPN). But it also monitors the apps that users use, reporting the data back to Facebook HQ — something the social network has used to identify competitors early and even prompt acquisitions.   According to the WSJ's report, Apple came to the conclusion that the app broke its new rules on data collection, and told Facebook as much earlier in August.   Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment,  but a company spokesperson told CNBC:   ""We work hard to protect user privacy and data security throughout the Apple ecosystem. With the latest update to our guidelines, we made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a user's device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing and must make it clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used.""   In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""We've always been clear when people download Onavo about the information that is collected and how it is used. As a developer on Apple's platform we follow the rules they've put in place.""   According to previous reports from the Wall Street Journal, Facebook has used Onavo to do everything from  monitoring usage of competing apps like Snapchat to  surfacing up-and-coming apps like videochat app Houseparty, and then cloning its core features.                                                                                               Critics have long held that Facebook doesn't do enough to advertise its ownership of Onavo — you have to scroll all the way to the bottom of its description in smartphone app stores to see that disclosure; something not every would-be user may do. Earlier this year, privacy advocates were upset when the  core Facebook app suggested users download Onavo Protect, without disclosing that relationship. It's been called ""vampiric"" and ""spyware"" by pundits.   A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment as to whether the company will take action on Onavo of its own.

The app was ""mostly active before 2012,"" writes Facebook VP Ime Archibong, and is now banned from the platform. And there's no indication that ""myPersonality"" had access to the data of its users' Facebook friends, so it will only notify those affected.   This is evocative of the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the users of an app called ""thisisyourdigitallife,"" and that of those users' friends, had their personal data improperly obtained by a political research firm with ties to the Trump presidential campaign. All told, the incident affected  as many as 87 million Facebook users.  In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook  instituted an app auditing process, where it would go through and  vet every app that integrated with the social network — past and present — to make sure that it didn't mishandle or resell the personal data that it gathered, in violation of Facebook's policies.   However, Archibong writes that ""myPersonality"" came to Facebook's attention after ""failing to agree to our request to audit and because it's clear that they shared information with researchers as well as companies with only limited protections in place.""   In other words, while Facebook either can't or won't say how the data gathered by ""myPersonality"" was used, it's confident enough that the data was mishandled to take action.  Read more:  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress about Cambridge Analytica and Russia  Notably, Facebook has been  investigating ""myPersonality"" since at least April, when it suspended the app from the site. It was reported in May that the app had some 6 million users, 40% of whom shared their personal data with the site.   Also of note is that Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created ""thisisyourdigitallife,"" also contributed to ""myPersonality,"" which was created in 2007 by Dr. David Stillwell at the University of Cambridge.                                                                                               In a statement to Business Insider, Dr. Stillwell claims that Facebook knew all about ""myPersonality,"" and in 2009 actually certified it as a ""verified application.""   ""It is therefore odd that Facebook should suddenly now profess itself to have been unaware of the myPersonality research and to believe that the data may have been misused,"" Dr. Stillwell writes. You can read his full statement below.   ""I am aware that Facebook have banned the myPersonality application as its users' data ""may have been misused"". The app has not been in use since July 2012 so this ban is nonsensical and purely for PR reasons. When the app was suspended three months ago I asked Facebook to explain which of their terms was broken but so far they have been unable to cite any instances.   ""Just to be clear, all necessary consents were explicitly and repeatedly provided by all Facebook users when using the myPersonality app. Data was not sought nor obtained from users' friends.   ""Facebook has long been aware of the application's use of data for research. In 2009 Facebook certified the app as compliant with their terms by making it one of their first 'verified applications.' In 2011 Facebook invited me to a meeting in Silicon Valley (and paid my travel expenses) for a workshop organised by Facebook precisely because it wanted more academics to use its data, and in 2015 Facebook invited Dr Kosinski to present our research at their headquarters.                                                                                               ""It is therefore odd that Facebook should suddenly now profess itself to have been unaware of the myPersonality research and to believe that the data may have been misused.   ""Important research papers have been published due to the generosity of myPersonality users who opted in to share their data for anonymized research. Research published with myPersonality data warning about the privacy risks of Facebook data (such as Facebook Likes) has had major policy impact through citations in  UK,  EU, Australian and Dutch government data policy reports. Most recently, the UK Parliament's DCMS Committee report into fake news  quoted (p.30) a 2014 academic publication based on myPersonality data warning about the potential for Facebook data misuse.

The 39-year-old security professional argues that while Russia pioneered information warfare techniques in 2016, its ""playbook"" is now publicly available for other nation-states and malicious actors to follow, with potentially devastating results.   Russian agents infamously used Facebook to spread misinformation and sow division in America in the run-up to the 2016 election, in support of their favored candidate, Donald Trump — as well as  attempting to hack Democratic Party figures and leaking their emails.   By most accounts, the Silicon Valley company was blindsided by the covert efforts. Its executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have since said they had focused on traditional security threats like hacking but hadn't sufficiently considered how their platform could be misused.   There have since been further disclosures of influence campaigns being run on Facebook following the election with targets around the world, including four campaigns that Facebook announced discovery of this week operated by Iran and Russia.   Stamos warned that if meaningful steps are not taken, there could be more election-related hacking and influence campaigns to come: ""There are many other U.S. adversaries with well-developed cyber-warfare capabilities, such as China or North Korea, that could decide to push candidates and positions amenable to them—including those supported by Democrats and opposed by Republicans.

Rose is the latest in a string of high-profile executive departures at Facebook as the company finds itself buffeted by a storm of controversies, including the use of its platform to spread misinformation and interfere in elections around the world.

He said that he ""semi-commuted"" between Hawaii and Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters, but has now decided to live full-time in the island state to better focus on his family.   ""[Facebook CEO] Mark [Zuckerberg] and [COO] Sheryl [Sandberg] changed my life and my career. I would walk through fire for them, or fly across the ocean on a regular basis,"" writes Rose.   ""But they deserve someone in my role who is present and fully engaged every day in the many opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.""   Before Facebook, Rose was at Amazon, where he helped introduce the Kindle e-book reader. At Facebook, he helped negotiate a deal with Apple that saw its social features integrated with the iPhone, as well as an advertising deal with Microsoft that later turned into a $240 million investment that valued the company at $15 billion.   In his Facebook post, Rose said that he plans to stay on through at least the Mobile World Congress event in early February, leaving him time to come up with a formal plan for the transition. He noted that he's not ruling out the possibility of taking some other role with Facebook. And he said he plans to invest and advise smaller companies.

One third of Facebook users in US now say they're using the social network and its sister site Instagram less than they were last year, according to a new survey.   Investment bank PiperJaffray asked 1,300 American users of Facebook and Instagram whether they were using the social networks more or less than they did in 2017, according to a note it distributed to investors on Wednesday.   The results: 33% of users said they were using Instagram and Facebook less, while 67% said they were using the two services either the same amount or more (individual figures weren't broken out).   The findings highlight a growing stated apathy towards the social network, and point to potential consequences to come following the greatest crisis in its history.   It has been an ugly year for the Silicon Valley company.   Facebook admitted political research firm Cambridge Analytica misappropriated tens of millions of users' data; CEO Mark Zuckerberg was hauled before Congress for a highly publicized two days of testimony; the social network came under intense scrutiny over how conspiracy theorist like Alex Jones use it to spread hoaxes, and more.   The actual impact of this thus far, however, has been limited. Its stock plummeted 20% following its second quarter financial results when it posted disappointing forward guidance — but this is in part because Facebook is actively choosing to invest in new security and safety initiatives.                                                                                               Meanwhile,  user growth is flatlining in developed markets like the US and Europe where the company has been deeply entrenched for years (though its global userbase continues to grow).   But so far, the company's publicly disclosed usage numbers — which are limited to the total amount of ""daily active users"" and ""monthly active users"" — have not show any decline in usage comparable to what's indicated in the PiperJafray survey.   It may be that US users are cutting back the hours per day that they spend on Facebook, while still using the social network every day — a trend that would not be reflected in the metrics Facebook discloses. Certainly if Facebook were to experience a 33% drop-off in its daily or monthly active userbase in the US, the consequences to the company's business and stock price would be devastating.   It's worth noting that a study by Goldman Sachs has a finding contrary to PiperJaffray's —  that US users may have actually increased the amount of time they spent on Facebook following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.   And PiperJaffray itself is playing down the significance of the usage decline detected in its survey. Michael Olson, the author of the PiperJaffray report, suggested that respondents may have been under-reporting their own usage and that the real portion of declining users may be smaller.                                                                                               ""While 1/3 of users did suggest they're using Facebook & Instagram less than last year, we suspect there is a greater tendency for users to under-report their usage rather than over-report,"" he wrote. "" It's impossible to quantify this suspected ""under reporting,"" but we believe that the actual percentage of users using these services less y/y is well below the 1/3 noted in our survey.""   Even if that's the case though, the survey highlights a worrisome problem for Facebook. It points to a very significant proportion of Facebook's userbase who believe they are reducing their usage — which will be linked to a shifting of attitudes towards the services.   If users are mentally checking out of Facebook and Instagram now, then more serious consequences for the company may soon follow.    ",0.064,0.843,0.093,0.9247

Digital publishers' ""pivot to video"" is now going to longer form content. In recent years, publishers have been increasing their focus on short-form clips designed for social media. But distributing short-form clips on news feeds has contributed only limited revenues for digital publishers, despite offering massive reach.   In search of better deals, publishers have sought production deals to make higher quality, longer form video in partnership with streaming video platforms or TV networks. These deals can deliver higher engagement, fan loyalty, and brand-building clout.   Going forward, Mic plans to produce more long-form shows for subscription video on demand (SVOD) platforms and TV networks: In addition to its Facebook Watch deal, Mic is also coproducing a documentary for Hulu about the disastrous Fyre Festival, and is in talks with Amazon and Netflix.   This strategy is in line with similar pushes at Vox Entertainment, which has landed shows on CNN, FYI, Netflix, and PBS; CondÃ© Nast Entertainment, which has six Netflix shows; Fusion Media Group, which has coproduced five Netflix series; and Vice Media, with long-running ""Vice News"" on HBO.

Twitter announced it had suspended 284 accounts for ""coordinated manipulation,"" shortly after  Facebook announced it had removed 652 pages for the same reason.    The suspensions apparently came after  a report from the cybersecurity firm FireEye, which was credited with tipping off Facebook about the coordinated Iranian influence operation.   According to FireEye's report, viewed by Business Insider, the misinformation campaign involved a network of news sites and accounts on Instagram, Twitter, Google+, and YouTube.   Example publications were ""US Journal"" and ""Critics Chronicle,"" which purported to be independent news sites based in California and Birmingham, England, respectively.   In addition to the fake-news sites, the report identified Twitter accounts posing as individuals living in the US and UK. Some of these accounts used photographs appropriated from online sources, including photos of people found in student and employee biographies.   The report also identified Google+ and YouTube accounts used by the Liberty Front Press.   FireEye analyst Lee Foster said in a statement that the operation aimed to ""promote political narratives in line with Iranian interests, including anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes."" Anti-Trump material was also prevalent, according to the report.

The revelation of Iran-backed subterfuge on Facebook, although an effort that began several years ago, underscores the extent to which consumer-oriented social networks have become the front lines in a shadowy battle among various nations and organizations to influence and distort public perception.   Facebook said the Russian and Iranian-based efforts were distinct, and that it has not found any links between them, but that they both used similar tactics that involved ""creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing.""   ""We ban this kind of behavior because we want people to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook,"" the company said in the post.   The findings come ahead of the 2018 US midterm elections, and is the latest example of social media services like Facebook being used as  propaganda platforms to spread misinformation and sow division among the public, following  Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 US Presidential election.   On a call with reporters following the announcement,  CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested there may be more disclosures of information campaigns to come in the months ahead: ""I think it's safe to say we have a number of investigations going on, and we'll update you when we know more.""   The revelations seems certain to increase the political heat on Facebook and CEO Zuckerberg, with Senator Mark Warner, of Virginia, tweeting that that he looked forward to learning more about the incidents in upcoming Congressional hearings with Facebook, Twitter and Google.    Facebook said it has purged its platforms of 652 pages, groups, and accounts. According to the company, the removed Pages and accounts involve two distinct strands — those from Iran, and those from Russia.                                                                                               Among the Iran pages, Facebook said that it detected three separate campaigns, two of which were connected and have been linked to Iranian state media. The three campaigns targeted people across multiple internet services in the Middle East, Latin America, UK and US.   One strand of the Iran activities involved accounts affiliated with what Facebook described as ""traditional cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to hack people's accounts and spread malware."" Facebook said that it had previously detected the hacking attempts and disrupted them.   Facebook credited FireEye, a cybersecurity firm, for tipping it off to a network of Iran-backed sites called the ""Liberty Front Press"" which pretented to be independent news organizations and civil society organizations. Upon investigating the network, Facebook said it was able to use website registration information and IP addresses to determine that Liberty Front Press was in fact linked to Iranian state media.   ""One part of the network, 'Quest 4 Truth,' claims to be an independent Iranian media organization, but is in fact linked to Press TV, an English-language news network affiliated with Iranian state media,"" Facebook said.

Some of the Iran Facebook pages also hosted real world events, Facebook said.   While Facebook said the accounts posted political content, initially aimed at the Middle East and Latin America, and starting in 2017 increasingly aimed at the US and UK, it did not accuse the groups of seeking to interfere in the US midterm elections.   Meanwhile, Facebook also took down pages, groups, and accounts ""that can be linked to sources the US government has previously identified as Russian military intelligence services,"" the company said. These were focused on politics in Syria and Ukraine, two countries of political importance to Russia.                                              Reuters                                      Russia was found to have used  Facebook to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election, buying up advertisements and spreading divisive messages or fake news.                                                                                               These actions kicked off a chain of scandals for Facebook that the company is still struggling to recover from, and it has since acknowleged it was caught unawares and that it is investing significant capital in new security and safety efforts.   Zuckerberg suggested on Tuesday that these increased investments were working, and that the company was able to detect the campaigns increasingly early. ""We're starting to see it pay off and we're identifying more of this before the election,"" he said.  Facebook previously detected fake accounts like this one, designed to interfere with the 2018 US midterm elections                                            Facebook                                    In July 2018,  Facebook announced it had detected a coordinated information campaign intended to influence US politics ahead of the midterms— the first such information campaign it had announced discovering this election cycle.   In that campaign, dozens of accounts were engaged in ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"" and organised dozens of real-world events, often working with unwitting legitimate activists in the US.   Facebook did not identify who was behind it, but said there were similarities to previous Russian disinfinformation campaigns. The content seems to have been designed to be politically divisive, and was generally left-wing, sometimes directly opposing President Donald Trump.

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump suggested, without evidence, that the companies’ activities may be illegal.  He later posted a tweet saying Google had for years promoted former President Barack Obama’s State of the Union addresses on its home page, but stopped the practice when Trump took office last year. The tweet included screenshots of the Google home page and the hashtag #StopTheBias.   A Google representative said the company “highlighted the livestream of President Trump’s State of the Union on the google.com homepage” on Jan. 30.  Google did not promote either president’s first speech to the U.S. Congress, “which is technically not a State of the Union address,” the representative said.  “I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter ... treat conservatives and Republicans very unfairly,” Trump said in his White House remarks.   “I think it’s a very serious problem because they’re really trying to silence a very large part of this country, and those people don’t want to be silenced. It’s not right. It’s not fair. It may not be legal, but we’ll see. We just want fairness,” Trump added.  The Republican president on Tuesday accused Google’s search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding “fair media” coverage of him, vowing to address the situation without providing evidence or giving details of action he might take.

Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, was speaking after U.N. experts accused Myanmar generals of “genocidal intent” and said Facebook had allowed its platform to be used to incite violence against Rohingya.  Facebook said on Monday it was removing several Myanmar military officials from the social media website and an Instagram account to prevent the spread of “hate and misinformation” after reviewing the content.  Zeid, whose spokesman said he has met with major tech companies in Silicon Valley, including Facebook and Google, in recent months, was speaking to a news conference before his four-year term ends on Aug. 31.  Zeid said he didn’t feel Facebook took the issue seriously at first but that the company’s attitude began to change after Yanghee Lee, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, told a Geneva press conference in March that Facebook was being used in the country to spread hate speech.  “But it shouldn’t be because the press or the human rights community highlights the problem for them then suddenly to respond. They should be aware of it ahead of time,” he said.  “So I don’t think they should wait until the crisis begins. They should be thinking proactively about what steps they will take to mitigate that,” he added.  Facebook said on Monday that while it was too slow to act in the case of Myanmar, it was now making progress, with better technology to identify hate speech and improved reporting tools.   However, Zeid said there was a danger that social media could be over-regulated in a way that breaches human rights law including the right to freedom of expression.  Tech giants should “keep the broadest space available and open to the exercise of freedom of expression”, relying on international human rights law for regulation, he said.   U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused Google’s search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding “fair media” coverage of him, vowing to address the situation without providing evidence or giving details of action he might take.  Trump’s attack against the Alphabet Inc unit follows a string of grievances against technology companies, including Twitter Inc and Facebook, which he has accused of silencing conservative voices.

Facebook’s Head of Video Fidji Simo said Watch was gaining real momentum in a crowded marketplace because it was built on the notion that watching videos could be a social activity.  “Every month more than 50 million people in the U.S. come to watch videos for at least a minute on Watch, and total time spent watching video on Facebook Watch has increased by 14 times since the start of 2018,” she told reporters.  “With Watch ... you can have a two-way conversation about the content with friends, other fans or even the creatives themselves.”  Facebook said eligible creators would be able to make money from their videos using its Ad Breaks service in Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand as well as the United States from Thursday, with many more countries set to follow.   Simo said publishers were making “meaningful revenues” from its automated video advertising system on the platform, which has featured shows such as beauty mogul Huda Kattan’s “Huda Boss” and live “Major League Baseball” games.   “We know it’s been a long road but we’ve worked hard to ensure that the Ad Breaks experience is a good one for both our partners and our community,” she said.  Ad revenue will be split 55 percent for the content creator and 45 percent for Facebook, the same ratio as in the United States, Simo said.  Publishers need to have createdÂ three-minute videos that have generated more than 30,000 one-minute views in total over the past two months and must haveÂ 10,000Â followers to participate in Ad Breaks, Facebook said.  Simo said Facebook was working on a variety of other options for creators to make money, such as branded content and the ability for fans to directly support their favorite creators through subscriptions.  “(Fan subscription) is something that is rolled out to a few creators now, but we are planning on expanding that program soon,” she said.

The U.N. report marked the first time the organisation has explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over a brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims last year.  “Our stance is clear and I want to say sharply that we don’t accept any resolutions conducted by the Human Rights Council,” the main government spokesman, Zaw Htay, said in an interview published in state media.  The fact-finding mission on Myanmar was established in March 2017 by the U.N. Human Rights Council.  Myanmar did not allow U.N investigators to enter the country, Zaw Htay said, adding: “That’s why we don’t agree and accept any resolutions made by the Human Rights Council”.  He said the country has “zero tolerance to any human rights violation” and had set up a Commission of Enquiry to respond to “false allegations” made by the U.N. and “other international communities”.  The government earlier this year set up a panel comprised of two Myanmar and two international members â Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo and Kenzo Oshima, Japan’s former ambassador to the U.N. - to investigate human rights abuses.  Myanmar has denied most of the allegations, saying the military responded to a legitimate threat from Rohingya militants, who attacked police posts across the western Rakhine state.  “If there is any case against human rights, just give us strong evidence, record and date so that we can take legal action against those who break the rules and regulations,” Zaw Htay said.  Malaysia’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was Myanmar’s responsibility to take action against those to blame for the alleged genocide committed in Rakhine State.  Should Myanmar prove “unwilling or incapable of ensuring justice”, the U.N. Security Council should step in and establish an international judicial mechanism to try the individuals most responsible for the crimes, the ministry said.  “Malaysia will continue to speak about the plight of the Rohingyas. We will also continue to call for international support for the Government of Bangladesh, in which close to a million Rohingyas have found refuge,” Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said in the statement.  Around 700,000 Rohingya have fled the military crackdown in western state of Rakhine to neighbouring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies. They joined nearly 200,000 Rohingya who had been already been living in camps there for years.  In the Bangladesh capital Dhaka, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam told reporters the U.N. produced “the most comprehensive, factual and crucial report since the attack in August last year”.  Alam said it was natural for Myanmar to reject the report, but he added: “That does not matter. The world knows everything”.  On the same day that the U.N. released its report, Facebook shut down the account of army general Min Aung Hlaing and other top military officials, accusing them of using its platform to spread “hate and misinformation”.  In the interview published on Wednesday, Zaw Htay said the government had not ordered the ban and was questioning Facebook about the action, saying it had caused “mounting criticism and fear among the people”.

The U.N. report marked the first time the organisation has explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over a brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims last year.  “Our stance is clear and I want to say sharply that we don’t accept any resolutions conducted by the Human Rights Council,” the main government spokesman, Zaw Htay, said in an interview published in state media.  The fact-finding mission on Myanmar was established in March 2017 by the U.N. Human Rights Council.  Myanmar did not allow U.N investigators to enter the country, Zaw Htay said, adding: “That’s why we don’t agree and accept any resolutions made by the Human Rights Council”.  He said the country has “zero tolerance to any human rights violation” and had set up a Commission of Enquiry to respond to “false allegations” made by the U.N. and “other international communities”.  The government earlier this year set up a panel comprised of two Myanmar and two international members â Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo and Kenzo Oshima, Japan’s former ambassador to the U.N. - to investigate human rights abuses.  Myanmar has denied most of the allegations, saying the military responded to a legitimate threat from Rohingya militants, who attacked police posts across the western Rakhine state.  “If there is any case against human rights, just give us strong evidence, record and date so that we can take legal action against those who break the rules and regulations,” Zaw Htay said.  Malaysia’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was Myanmar’s responsibility to take action against those to blame for the alleged genocide committed in Rakhine State.  Should Myanmar prove “unwilling or incapable of ensuring justice”, the U.N. Security Council should step in and establish an international judicial mechanism to try the individuals most responsible for the crimes, the ministry said.  “Malaysia will continue to speak about the plight of the Rohingyas. We will also continue to call for international support for the Government of Bangladesh, in which close to a million Rohingyas have found refuge,” Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said in the statement.  Around 700,000 Rohingya have fled the military crackdown in western state of Rakhine to neighbouring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies. They joined nearly 200,000 Rohingya who had been already been living in camps there for years.  In the Bangladesh capital Dhaka, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam told reporters the U.N. produced “the most comprehensive, factual and crucial report since the attack in August last year”.  Alam said it was natural for Myanmar to reject the report, but he added: “That does not matter. The world knows everything”.  On the same day that the U.N. released its report, Facebook shut down the account of army general Min Aung Hlaing and other top military officials, accusing them of using its platform to spread “hate and misinformation”.  In the interview published on Wednesday, Zaw Htay said the government had not ordered the ban and was questioning Facebook about the action, saying it had caused “mounting criticism and fear among the people”.

Facebook and other companies said last week that multiple social media accounts and websites were part of an Iranian project to covertly influence public opinion in other countries. A Reuters analysis has identified 10 more sites and dozens of social media accounts across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.  U.S.-based cyber security firm FireEye Inc and Israeli firm ClearSky reviewed Reuters’ findings and said technical indicators showed the web of newly-identified sites and social media accounts - called the International Union of Virtual Media, or IUVM - was a piece of the same campaign, parts of which were taken down last week by Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc.   IUVM pushes content from Iranian state media and other outlets aligned with the government in Tehran across the internet, often obscuring the original source of the information such as Iran’s PressTV, FARS news agency and al-Manar TV run by the Iran-backed Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah.  PressTV, FARS, al-Manar TV and representatives for the Iranian government did not respond to requests for comment. The Iranian mission to the United Nations last week dismissed accusations of an Iranian influence campaign as “ridiculous.”   The extended network of disinformation highlights how multiple state-affiliated groups are exploiting social media to manipulate users and further their geopolitical agendas, and how difficult it is for tech companies to guard against political interference on their platforms.   In July, a U.S. grand jury indicted 12 Russians whom prosecutors said were intelligence officers, on charges of hacking political groups in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. officials have said Russia, which has denied the allegations, could also attempt to disrupt congressional elections in November.  Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab who has previously analysed disinformation campaigns for Facebook, said the IUVM network displayed the extent and scale of the Iranian operation.   “It’s a large-scale amplifier for Iranian state messaging,” Nimmo said. “This shows how easy it is to run an influence operation online, even when the level of skill is low. The Iranian operation relied on quantity, not quality, but it stayed undetected for years.”  Facebook spokesman Jay Nancarrow said the company is still investigating accounts and pages linked to Iran and had taken more down on Tuesday.   “This is an ongoing investigation and we will continue to find out more,” he said. “We’re also glad to see that the information we and others shared last week has prompted additional attention on this kind of inauthentic behaviour.”  Twitter referred to a statement it tweeted on Monday shortly after receiving a request for comment from Reuters. The statement said the company had removed a further 486 accounts for violating its terms of use since last week, bringing the total number of suspended accounts to 770.  “Fewer than 100 of the 770 suspended accounts claimed to be located in the U.S. and many of these were sharing divisive social commentary,” Twitter said.  Google declined to comment but took down the IUVM TV YouTube account after Reuters contacted the company with questions about it. A message on the page on Tuesday said the account had been “terminated for a violation of YouTube’s Terms of Service.”  IUVM did not respond to multiple emails or social media messages requesting comment.  The organisation does not conceal its aims, however. Documents on the main IUVM website said its headquarters are in Tehran and its objectives include “confronting with remarkable arrogance, western governments and Zionism front activities.”       APP STORE AND SATIRICAL CARTOONS    IUVM uses its network of websites - including a YouTube channel, breaking news service, mobile phone app store, and a hub for satirical cartoons mocking Israel and Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia - to distribute content taken from Iranian state media and other outlets which support Tehran’s position on geopolitical issues.  Reuters recorded the IUVM network operating in English, French, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Pashto, Russian, Hindi, Azerbaijani, Turkish and Spanish.  Much of the content is then reproduced by a range of alternative media sites, including some of those identified by FireEye last week as being run by Iran while purporting to be domestic American or British news outlets.  For example, an article run by in January by Liberty Front Press - one of the pseudo-U.S. news sites exposed by FireEye - reported on the battlefield gains made by the army of Iranian ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. That article was sourced to IUVM but actually lifted from two FARS news agency stories.  FireEye analyst Lee Foster said iuvmpress.com, one of the biggest IUVM websites, was registered in January 2015 with the same email address used to register two sites already identified as being run by Iran.

Trump’s attack against the Alphabet Inc unit follows a string of grievances against technology companies, including social media Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc, which he has accused of silencing conservative voices, and Amazon.com Inc, which he has said is hurting small businesses and benefiting from a favorable deal with the U.S. Postal Services.

Google denied any political bias, saying in a statement that its search engine is “not used to set a political agenda and we don’t bias our results toward any political ideology.”  Trump said in several tweets on Tuesday that Google search results for “Trump News” were “rigged” against him because they showed only coverage from outlets like CNN and not conservative publications, suggesting the practice was illegal.  “I think Google is really taking advantage of our people,” Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. “Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful. It’s not fair to large portions of the population.”  Facebook declined to comment. Twitter did not comment when asked for a response. In congressional testimony, both companies have denied engaging in partisan censorship.  Neither Trump nor the White House detailed how or under what legal justification they would use to probe Google.   Trump’s economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later told reporters that the White House was “taking a look” at Google, saying the administration would do “some investigation and some analysis,” without providing further details.  Earlier this summer, the new Republican chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. In a previous investigation, the FTC decided that Google was likely justified in developing a search function that harmed other companies.  In June Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Google’s alleged anticompetitive behavior in the online search and advertising markets.  Congressional sources cautioned that it may be difficult for Trump to find a way to probe Google about news search results, and that Congress is unlikely to pass any applicable laws.   U.S. member of Congress Ted Lieu, a Democrat, said in a tweet directed at Trump that such restrictions on Google would violate the U.S. Constitution: “If government tried to dictate the free speech algorithms of private companies, courts would strike it down in a nanosecond.”     Shares of Alphabet closed down 0.8 percent at $1,245.86.  While the exact science behind Google searches on the internet is kept secret, its basic principles are widely known to be generated with a variety of factors measured by the company’s algorithms.  The factors Google uses to determine which websites appear first in search results include how often that page is linked to on other sites, the use of keywords, the popularity and respectability of the news site, and personal browsing history of the person conducting the search.   Highly trafficked and cited websites like CNN.com and NYTimes.com, two of the most Trump’s most frequent targets, often appear first in search results.      Trump’s accusation of bias on the part of Google comes as social media companies have suspended accounts, banned certain users and removed content as they face pressure from the U.S. Congress to police foreign propaganda and fake accounts aimed at disrupting American politics, including operations tied to Iran and Russia.       Companies such as Facebook and Twitter have also been pressed to remove conspiracy driven content and hate speech.      Tech companies have said they do not remove content for political reasons.      Some Republican U.S. lawmakers have also raised concerns about social media companies removing content from some conservatives, and have called Twitter’s chief executive to testify before a House of Representatives panel on Sept. 5.  Earlier this month, Alphabet’s YouTube joined Apple Inc and Facebook in removing some content from Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

Instagram said on Tuesday it will launch the “About This Account” feature that will allow users to see the advertisements an account is running, the country where the account is located, username changes in the past year as well as other details.  “Keeping people with bad intentions off our platform is incredibly important ... that means trying to make sure the people you follow and the accounts you interact with are who they say they are, and stopping bad actors before they cause harm,” Instagram co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Mike Krieger said.  Instagram also said it will allow the use of third-party apps such as DUO Mobile and Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication to help users securely log in to their accounts.  Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security on top of usernames and passwords by prompting users for information they have access to.  Earlier this month, Facebook introduced this feature for users who managed pages with a large U.S. following, seeking to make it harder to administer a page using a fake or compromised account.  These features will be broadly available in the coming weeks, the photo-sharing app said in a blog post.  Starting Tuesday, Instagram will allow accounts with a large reach to request verification through a feature within the app, it said.

Comments by Fidelity Contrafund’s Will Danoff, who like other top mutual fund managers rarely voices an opinion about a holding, represent key support for management as some investors seek change at Facebook, but also drew criticism that he should take a tougher line.  In a commentary emailed on Monday by the Boston fund firm, Danoff said Facebook, his fund’s largest position, “confronted some stiff headwinds” in the first six months of 2018.  Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, was hauled before U.S. Congress in April to explain how data belonging to 87 million users was improperly shared with a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, and why it ran ads and posts placed by Russian operatives in what U.S. authorities believe was an attempt to influence the U.S. 2016 election.  “Facebook management responded thoroughly to legislators’ concerns and implemented a comprehensive plan to uphold the trustworthiness of its digital communities,” Danoff said in a question-and-answer portion of the commentary, which was dated June 30 and included in a ‘Fidelity Investment Insights’ email on Monday.  A Fidelity spokeswoman said Danoff would not elaborate on the comments. A spokeswoman for Facebook, which has described steps it is taking to combat abuse of its service, declined to comment on Danoff’s note.  Facebook’s failure to protect users’ data and to police some misleading content has caused some shareholders to call for change at the company.  Activists put several reforms up for votes at Facebook’s annual meeting in May, including calls for a risk committee and a report on content. None gained a majority of votes, but Facebook later gave a board committee new risk oversight responsibilities.  Passing proposals opposed by Zuckerberg is nigh on impossible, given that Facebook’s dual share structure means he has control of about 60 percent of the company’s voting shares.  A filing last week showed Contrafund sided against most of the reforms and backed all Facebook directors in board elections. Danoff’s commentary did not address the thinking behind the votes.  Some had hoped Contrafund, with $131 billion in assets, would push for reform at Facebook.  “Support like this matters,” said Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC, an organization that works with asset managers to file and promote shareholder resolutions including at Facebook’s meeting held on May 31. “Even Mark Zuckerberg will listen to these kinds of people.” Connor said.

A report by investigators was the first time the United Nations has explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over their campaign against the Rohingya, and is likely to deepen the country’s isolation.  The investigators called for the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar, subject its officials to targeted sanctions and set up an ad hoc tribunal to try suspects or refer them to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.  The report also could serve as a major catalyst for change in how the world’s big social media companies handle hate speech in parts of the world where they have limited direct presence but their platforms command huge influence.  The investigators sharply criticised Facebook, which has become Myanmar’s dominant social media network despite having no employees there, for letting its platform be used to incite violence and hatred.  Facebook responded on Monday by announcing it was blocking 20 Myanmar officials and organisations found by the U.N. panel to have “committed or enabled serious human rights abuses”.  The company already acknowledged this month that it had been ""too slow"" to respond to incitement in Myanmar, following a Reuters investigative report into its failure to tackle rampant hate speech including calls for all Rohingya to be killed. here  The U.N. investigators blamed Myanmar’s de facto civilian leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to use her “moral authority” to protect civilians. Her government “contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes” by letting hate speech thrive, destroying documents and failing to shield minorities from crimes against humanity and war crimes.  “Our findings are grim,” panel chairman Marzuki Darusman told a news conference on Monday. “We believe that establishing the facts is the first stepping stone towards change.”Contacted by phone, Myanmar military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi said he could not immediately comment. Zaw Htay, spokesman for Suu Kyi’s government, could not immediately be reached for comment. Reuters was also unable to contact the six generals named in the report. The Myanmar government was sent an advance copy of the U.N. report in line with standard practice.  A year ago, government troops led a brutal crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine state in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on 30 Myanmar police posts and a military base. Some 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh.  The U.N. report said the military action was “grossly disproportionate to actual security threats”.  “The crimes in Rakhine State, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,” said the U.N. panel, known as the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar.  The United States, which is preparing its own report on the anti-Rohingya campaign, sees the U.N. findings adding to growing evidence of “widespread human rights abuses” by Myanmar forces, a State Department spokesman said.  But the U.S. government will only decide whether to call it genocide or crimes against humanity - in line with the U.N.’s determinations - “after a thorough review of the available facts and relevant legal analysis,” the spokesman said.  Critics have accused Washington of an overly cautious response to the Rohingya crisis, but a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.N. findings could increase pressure for tougher U.S. action.  Suu Kyi’s government has rejected most allegations of atrocities made against the security forces by refugees. It has built transit centres for refugees to return, but U.N. aid agencies say it is not yet safe for them to do so.  The report said Suu Kyi “has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events, or seek alternative avenues to meet a responsibility to protect the civilian population”.  In Brussels, the European Union’s executive said it would  meet this week with the U.N. panel and discuss further steps.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will use all information at his disposal, including a U.S. report compiled from refugees’ accounts but which has yet to be released, to decide how to  “advance accountability” in Myanmar, his spokesman said.  Washington this month imposed sanctions on four military and police commanders and two army units but the military chief was spared. New sanctions are under consideration for half a dozen others, U.S. officials have said. But the State Department spokesman declined to specify what “additional tools” the United States would use.  The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare, but has been used in countries including Bosnia, Rwanda and Sudan.  The investigators documented rapes, sexual slavery and abductions, including of children, said panel member Radhika Coomeraswamy.  “The scale, brutality and systematic nature of rape and (sexual) violence indicate that they are part of deliberate strategy to intimidate, terrorise or punish the civilian population. They are used as a tactic of war,” she said.  Darusman said commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing should step down pending investigation.  The list of generals also included Brigadier-General Aung Aung, commander of the 33rd Light Infantry Division, which oversaw operations in the coastal village of Inn Din where 10 Rohingya captive boys and men were killed.  The incident, for which seven soldiers have since been jailed, was uncovered by two Reuters journalists - Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28 - who were arrested last December and are being tried on charges of violating Myanmar’s Official Secrets Act. The court had been due to deliver a verdict in their case on Monday, but postponed the proceedings until Sept. 3.  Other generals named in the report included army deputy commander-in-chief Vice Senior-General Soe Win; the commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-3, Lieutenant-General Aung Kyaw Zaw; the commander of Western Regional Military Command, Major-General Maung Maung Soe; and the commander of 99th Light Infantry Division, Brigadier-General Than Oo.  Panel member Christopher Sidoti said “the clarity of the chain of command in Myanmar” meant the six generals must be prosecuted, even in the absence of a “smoking gun” piece of evidence to prove who had ordered the crimes.  “We do not have a copy of a direct order that says ‘undertake genocide tomorrow please’. But that is the case almost universally when cases of genocide have gone before the courts,” Sidoti said.  The U.N. panel, set up last year, interviewed 875 victims and witnesses in Bangladesh and other countries, and analysed documents, videos, photographs and satellite images.  Decades of state-sponsored stigmatisation against Rohingya had resulted in “institutionalised oppression from birth to death”, the report said.   The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Myanmar’s Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by the country’s Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.  Members of the panel had accused Facebook in March of allowing its platform to be used to incite violence. The report said the social media company should have acted quicker.  “Although improved in recent months, Facebook’s response has been slow and ineffective. The extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discrimination and violence must be independently and thoroughly examined,” it said.  In a statement announcing its action on Monday, Facebook said it was removing 18 Facebook accounts, one Instagram account and 52 Facebook pages.  “The ethnic violence in Myanmar has been truly horrific. Earlier this month, we shared an update on the steps we’re taking to prevent the spread of hate and misinformation on Facebook. While we were too slow to act, we’re now making progress â with better technology to identify hate speech, improved reporting tools, and more people to review content.”  Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels, Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom in Washington; Writing by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Peter Graff, Toni Reinhold All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The probe is being closely watched in Europe amid mounting concerns over leaks of data on tens of millions of Facebook users, as well as the extensive use of targeted ads by foreign powers seeking to influence elections in the United States.   The Federal Cartel Office objects in particular to how Facebook acquires data on people from third-party apps - including its own WhatsApp and Instagram services - and its online tracking of people who aren’t even members.  “We are conscious that this should, and must, go quickly,” cartel office President Andreas Mundt told a news conference on Monday, adding that he hoped to take “first steps” this year. He declined to elaborate.  The German probe is not expected to end in fines for Facebook, in contrast to European Union probes into Google that have ended in multi-billion-dollar penalties, most recently over the preinstallation of its apps on Android smartphones.   Sources familiar with the matter say, however, that the cartel office could require Facebook to take action to address its concerns if the company fails to do so voluntarily.  Facebook responded earlier this year to the cartel office’s request for information, and the authority was reviewing whether new features - such as a “clear history” option announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in May - would address its concerns.  “We need to establish whether this affects our investigation and addresses our concerns,” Mundt said.  Separately, Mundt confirmed comments he made in a newspaper interview earlier this month that he may launch an investigation into the e-commerce industry under new powers that enable the cartel office to launch sector-wide probes.  The focus would be on so-called “hybrid” platforms such as U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN.O) that sell their own products and services, but that also host third-party traders.  “Our question is: what is the relationship between the platform, which itself is a very powerful trader, and the traders who use the platform?” said Mundt. He added that Amazon was the best-known of the e-commerce platforms but his interest in the matter extended to other players.  The cartel office would not be looking at suspected tax evasion by third-party traders on e-commerce platforms - an issue that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has vowed to tackle - saying this was a matter for economic policy makers.

A report by investigators was the first time the United Nations has explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over their campaign against the Rohingya, and is likely to deepen the country’s isolation.  The investigators called for the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar, subject its officials to targeted sanctions and set up an ad hoc tribunal to try suspects or refer them to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.  The report also could serve as a major catalyst for change in how the world’s big social media companies handle hate speech in parts of the world where they have limited direct presence but their platforms command huge influence.  The investigators sharply criticized Facebook, which has become Myanmar’s dominant social media network despite having no employees there, for letting its platform be used to incite violence and hatred.  Facebook responded on Monday by announcing it was blocking 20 Myanmar officials and organizations found by the U.N. panel to have “committed or enabled serious human rights abuses”.  The company already acknowledged this month that it had been ""too slow"" to respond to incitement in Myanmar, following a Reuters investigative report into its failure to tackle rampant hate speech including calls for all Rohingya to be killed. here  The U.N. investigators blamed Myanmar’s de facto civilian leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to use her “moral authority” to protect civilians. Her government “contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes” by letting hate speech thrive, destroying documents and failing to shield minorities from crimes against humanity and war crimes.  “Our findings are grim,” panel chairman Marzuki Darusman told a news conference on Monday. “We believe that establishing the facts is the first stepping stone towards change.”Contacted by phone, Myanmar military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi said he could not immediately comment. Zaw Htay, spokesman for Suu Kyi’s government, could not immediately be reached for comment. Reuters was also unable to contact the six generals named in the report. The Myanmar government was sent an advance copy of the U.N. report in line with standard practice.  A year ago, government troops led a brutal crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine state in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on 30 Myanmar police posts and a military base. Some 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh.  The U.N. report said the military action was “grossly disproportionate to actual security threats”.  “The crimes in Rakhine State, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,” said the U.N. panel, known as the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar.  The United States, which is preparing its own report on the anti-Rohingya campaign, sees the U.N. findings adding to growing evidence of “widespread human rights abuses” by Myanmar forces, a State Department spokesman said.  But the U.S. government will only decide whether to call it genocide or crimes against humanity - in line with the U.N.’s determinations - “after a thorough review of the available facts and relevant legal analysis,” the spokesman said.  Critics have accused Washington of an overly cautious response to the Rohingya crisis, but a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.N. findings could increase pressure for tougher U.S. action.  Suu Kyi’s government has rejected most allegations of atrocities made against the security forces by refugees. It has built transit centers for refugees to return, but U.N. aid agencies say it is not yet safe for them to do so.  The report said Suu Kyi “has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events, or seek alternative avenues to meet a responsibility to protect the civilian population”.  In Brussels, the European Union’s executive said it would  meet this week with the U.N. panel and discuss further steps.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will use all information at his disposal, including a U.S. report compiled from refugees’ accounts but which has yet to be released, to decide how to  “advance accountability” in Myanmar, his spokesman said.  Washington this month imposed sanctions on four military and police commanders and two army units but the military chief was spared. New sanctions are under consideration for half a dozen others, U.S. officials have said. But the State Department spokesman declined to specify what “additional tools” the United States would use.  The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare, but has been used in countries including Bosnia, Rwanda and Sudan.  The investigators documented rapes, sexual slavery and abductions, including of children, said panel member Radhika Coomeraswamy.  “The scale, brutality and systematic nature of rape and (sexual) violence indicate that they are part of deliberate strategy to intimidate, terrorize or punish the civilian population. They are used as a tactic of war,” she said.  Darusman said commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing should step down pending investigation.  The list of generals also included Brigadier-General Aung Aung, commander of the 33rd Light Infantry Division, which oversaw operations in the coastal village of Inn Din where 10 Rohingya captive boys and men were killed.  The incident, for which seven soldiers have since been jailed, was uncovered by two Reuters journalists - Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28 - who were arrested last December and are being tried on charges of violating Myanmar’s Official Secrets Act. The court had been due to deliver a verdict in their case on Monday, but postponed the proceedings until Sept. 3.  Other generals named in the report included army deputy commander-in-chief Vice Senior-General Soe Win; the commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-3, Lieutenant-General Aung Kyaw Zaw; the commander of Western Regional Military Command, Major-General Maung Maung Soe; and the commander of 99th Light Infantry Division, Brigadier-General Than Oo.  Panel member Christopher Sidoti said “the clarity of the chain of command in Myanmar” meant the six generals must be prosecuted, even in the absence of a “smoking gun” piece of evidence to prove who had ordered the crimes.  “We do not have a copy of a direct order that says ‘undertake genocide tomorrow please’. But that is the case almost universally when cases of genocide have gone before the courts,” Sidoti said.  The U.N. panel, set up last year, interviewed 875 victims and witnesses in Bangladesh and other countries, and analyzed documents, videos, photographs and satellite images.  Decades of state-sponsored stigmatization against Rohingya had resulted in “institutionalized oppression from birth to death”, the report said.   The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Myanmar’s Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by the country’s Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.  Members of the panel had accused Facebook in March of allowing its platform to be used to incite violence. The report said the social media company should have acted quicker.  “Although improved in recent months, Facebook’s response has been slow and ineffective. The extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discrimination and violence must be independently and thoroughly examined,” it said.  In a statement announcing its action on Monday, Facebook said it was removing 18 Facebook accounts, one Instagram account and 52 Facebook pages.  “The ethnic violence in Myanmar has been truly horrific. Earlier this month, we shared an update on the steps we’re taking to prevent the spread of hate and misinformation on Facebook. While we were too slow to act, we’re now making progress â with better technology to identify hate speech, improved reporting tools, and more people to review content.”  Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels, Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom in Washington; Writing by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Peter Graff, Toni Reinhold All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Sotoudeh said she was launching her protest over the recent arrest of a prominent civil rights activist and the harassment of his, and her own, family by security forces.  Sotoudeh served about half of a six-year jail sentence imposed in 2010 for spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security - charges she denied - before being freed in 2013.  She was arrested again in June and her husband, Reza Khandan, told Iranian media she is facing security charges.  “Since none of my correspondence with the authorities has produced a result, I have no choice but to start a hunger strike as of [August 25, 2018] in protest against the judicial arrests and pressure against my family, relatives and friends,” Sotoudeh wrote on Khandan’s Facebook page.  She added the words: “With the hope of the establishment of law and justice in our dear country Iran.”  Sotoudeh, who has represented Iranian opposition activists, embarked on an earlier 50-day hunger strike in 2012 against a travel ban on her daughter.  Her case then caused an international outcry in which the United States and the human rights group Amnesty International criticized the Islamic Republic and she was freed in September 2013 ahead of a visit to the United Nations by President Hassan Rouhani, soon after he was swept into office in part on promises of liberal reforms.  Sotoudeh recently represented a number of women who have removed their headscarves, or hijab, in public to protest against Iran’s mandatory Islamic dress code for women, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group.

Paul Ceglia, 45, a wood pellet salesman from Wellsville in upstate New York, had been missing since March 2015, when he removed his electronic ankle bracelet and disappeared with his wife, two children and a dog.  Ceglia fled less than two months before his scheduled trial in Manhattan federal court on mail fraud and wire fraud charges, over his alleged forging of documents to extort Facebook and Zuckerberg.  In a letter to U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick, prosecutors said Ceglia was arrested in Ecuador on Thursday morning and is expected to appear by Friday in a court in Quito, the country’s capital.  Prosecutors said they will update Broderick as they learn more about Ceglia’s extradition proceedings.  The criminal case arose from Ceglia’s conduct related to a 2010 civil lawsuit he had filed against Zuckerberg.  Ceglia claimed that Zuckerberg had, while a student at Harvard University, signed a 2003 contract giving him half of a planned social networking website that later became Facebook.  U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara in Buffalo dismissed Ceglia’s lawsuit after another judge said the contract was doctored.  The market value of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook is now close to $500 billion, and Forbes magazine said Zuckerberg’s own net worth is about $64.8 billion.  Ceglia was criminally charged in November 2012. News of his arrest was earlier reported by WGRZ television in Buffalo, about 85 miles (137 km) northwest of Wellsville.  Robert Ross Fogg, a lawyer for Ceglia in the criminal case, in a Thursday phone interview said he was “relieved” that Ceglia appeared to have been located without incident, and was “hoping that he and his family are safe.”  He also said there remained a “strong case” for Ceglia’s defense, and that Ceglia’s alleged agreement with Zuckerberg “truly was a contract.”  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The case is U.S. v. Ceglia, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00876.

Israel’s liaison office for Gaza, Cogat, named the Palestinian as Hani Majdalawi and said he was shot dead on Monday after shooting and throwing a grenade at soldiers.  “We have reached out to Doctors without Borders for clarification regarding the matter,” a Cogat spokesman said.  The organisation later confirmed in a statement that Majdalawi had been killed but did not elaborate.  “MSF is working to verify and understand the circumstances regarding this extremely serious incident, and is not able to comment further at this stage,” it said.   Its website says the group runs three burns and trauma centres in Gaza, whose Islamist Hamas rulers have fought three wars against Israel in the last decade.  Gaza authorities did not confirm Majdalawi’s death, saying that would require having his body, which they believed was being held by Israel. The Israeli military said it could not immediately confirm this.  No armed Palestinian factions claimed Majdalawi as a member.  Responding to Israeli media reports on Majdalawi’s killing, his brother, Osama, described the married 28-year-old on Facebook as a “martyr” who had “bought the weapon with his own money” and acted “completely independently”.      The Facebook post said Hani Majdalawi had worked for Doctors Without Borders and that he had been “the most socially, psychologically and economically stable among his brothers”.   Gaza has seen an almost five-month surge in confrontations along the border, where Palestinians have held weekly, sometimes violent mass demonstrations, drawing Israeli army gunfire. At least 170 Palestinians have been killed.  Writing by Dan Williams and Nidal al-Mughrabi; Editing by Andrew Roche and Mark Potter All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR here) brought in by the European Union in May is designed to protect personal information in the age of the internet and requires websites to seek consent to use personal data, among other measures.  The ability to track internet users has attracted hundreds of companies that harvest and crunch user data from websites - with or without the consent of the site owner â to form very specific individual consumer profiles.  GDPR poses a challenge to those groups because they all need consent to use the data. While sites often request consent on behalf of the ad tech firms they use directly, uncertainty over whether every link in the supply chain is GDPR-compliant is pushing some to leave Europe altogether.  Concerns about GDPR should, however, benefit Alphabet’s Google and Facebook as their loyal customers are more likely to give consent to carry on using sites, allowing the U.S. giants to keep amassing and analysing vast amounts of GDPR-compliant data that advertisers will pay to use.  Big publishers such as national newspapers are also likely to keep their readers and believe they can benefit by eventually charging advertisers more for online slots in the knowledge they are compliant with the new EU rules.  “It’s challenging for the digital ecosystem,” said Mark Read, joint boss at the world’s biggest ad agency, WPP.   “But if consumers feel confident that their data is being protected and they understand how it is being used and it’s done with permission, ultimately that should be a good thing for clients and for us,” he told Reuters.   From a standing start nearly 30 years ago, the internet has become the largest advertising medium in the world because it allows firms to target consumers with ads based on anything from their browsing history, comments, spending power to location.  Within the tangled ecosystem are multiple firms that help brands and ad agencies connect to sites that fund content with targeted ads. For every dollar spent by an advertiser, about half may go to ad tech groups, according to industry estimates.  When an internet user pulls up a page multiple bid requests are sent into the advertising ecosystem touting facts about the person such as demographics and interests, as well as the nature of the site they are viewing.   That personal data can then pass through a dozen or more ad tech firms before a company or ad agency bids at an auction for space on the website and an advert is loaded. It is that spread of personal data that risks breaking the new EU privacy law.   For example, a firm that provides ads for a website viewed on a mobile phone may use other partners not included in the compliance chain to provide information about a user’s location.  That doubt about compliance is threatening the myriad ad tech middlemen and is also prompting advertisers and publishers to rethink how they share their user data.  ""In a world where we are putting the consumer first, there are only going to be so many opportunities for the very colourful ecosystem of companies to obtain consent,"" said Andrew Casale, head of ad group Index Exchange www.indexexchange.com.  In the midst of the disruption, some ad tech groups are pulling out of Europe. Harry Kargman, founder of mobile ad firm Kargo www.kargo.com, told Reuters the company had withdrawn for now because it did not know how GDPR would be applied.   “There is too much uncertainty,” he said. “And I don’t think (that will change) until they apply it in specific cases.”  Verve www.verve.com, a company that helps advertisers target consumers on mobiles based on location, and Drawbridge www.drawbridge.com, a cross-device user data firm, have both stopped operating ad businesses in Europe.  Factual www.factual.com, another company that provides consumer data based on their location, also temporarily scaled back its operations in Europe after realizing the mobile apps it relies on ""could not safely claim they were compliant"".  Others groups higher up the food chain have also been hit.      France’s Publicis, one of the world’s top five advertising companies, said it had felt the effect.  “Advertisers were cautious about spending money in supply chains that they weren’t absolutely sure they could target safely or legally,” said Steve King, CEO of Publicis Media.   Kargo’s Kargman expects Facebook and Google to benefit from the uncertainty. The two companies are likely to receive a high ratio of user consent given their loyal customer base while both own high-quality data because users post likes, dislikes and location, or search for areas of interest on Google or YouTube.   The companies also have deep pockets so can ensure they are compliant, throwing engineers and lawyers at the problem and reassuring brands at a time of uncertainty.  But they too have had to make changes.   Facebook lost about 1 million European monthly active users after GDPR and it said a desire by some users to avoid targeted ads is likely to lead to a modest revenue hit.  In response to GDPR, it has asked advertisers to certify they have the proper consent to use any data from third-party brokers, potentially shedding itself of some liability.  Google is also requiring publishers to secure consent when using its ad products on their properties. Marketers and partners also need to now use more of Google’s own services.   It has stopped providing easy access to lists that helped companies evaluate the success of their ads by showing which users clicked on them. Advertisers must now use Google’s Ads Data Hub application to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.  Google declined to comment for this article. It has previously said GDPR is a big change and is working with partners on compliance.  Of the more than 20 executives spoken to by Reuters, from ad bosses to publishers, tech groups, brands, lawyers and consultants, all expect the supply chain to thin out - leaving publishers to potentially receive a greater slice of ad revenue.  ""Given the number of actors it could take some time though,"" said Phil Smith, head of UK advertiser trade body ISBA www.isba.org.uk.     Leading British sports website GiveMeSport www.givemesport.com is one publisher hoping the biggest overhaul of data privacy laws in more than 20 years will challenge the system.   “There are too many middlemen and they’ve been eating the cake,” General Manager Ryan Skeggs said. “We’re hoping GDPR will help weed them out. The sites that do well, theoretically speaking, should then make more money.”   Three of the leading UK newspaper groups - Rupert Murdoch's News UK www.news.co.uk, The Guardian www.theguardian.com and The Telegraph www.telegraph.co.uk - have joined forces in the Ozone Project to sell their online inventory, or ad space, together, offering advertisers access to 39 million users.   Project leader Damon Reeve said publishers had lost control of their data to tech vendors. By compiling only quality inventory, he hopes marketers and publishers will start sharing user data directly - making them less reliant on third parties.  That should provide a boost to the newspaper industry which is still grappling with the shift online, where ad rates are far lower than those charged for a space in a physical edition.  ""By 2020, Ozone could add circa 30 million pounds ($38 million) per annum â not a trivial contribution to a national newspaper newsroom,"" said analysts at consultancy Enders Analysis www.endersanalysis.com.  Adam Smith, a director at WPP's media buying arm GroupM www.groupm.com, agreed the focus on user compliance was likely to cut the amount of available inventory. ""That feeds into price inflation for the sought after inventory,"" he said.  How long the initial impact of GDPR will last, though, is not yet clear as many consumers - tired of the constant permission pop ups - are just giving consent to access sites. Prosecutors are also yet to bring any cases for data breaches.

In a reorganization spanning three sectors, none of the so-called FANG high-growth stocks - Facebook (FB.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - will be classified as technology companies, even though investors widely view them as the leaders of a tech rally that has powered the stock market higher in recent years.  On Sept. 24, S&P; will shift Alphabet, Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N), Paypal (PYPL.O) and videogame makers Electronic Arts (EA.O) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) from the S&P; 500 technology index to an expanded telecom group, renamed “Communications Services.”   Netflix, which like Amazon, is currently part of the consumer discretionary group, will also move to the expanded telecom group. Amazon will stay put in consumer discretionary.  The changes are part the largest-ever reorganization of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, an industry taxonomy widely used by investors. MSCI will adjust its indexes in November.   Meant to reflect the economy’s evolution, the overhaul of GICS will affect how mutual fund managers choose between stocks, and force passively managed sector funds to reallocate billions of dollars. Removing Alphabet and Facebook from technology indexes may lead investors to pay more attention to smaller, remaining technology companies.  “People will be able to get a clear look at the tech sector without being overwhelmed by these behemoths that really are media companies,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.   Exchange-traded funds that passively track indexes have about $89 billion invested in the technology sector, much of which will have to be reinvested to stay in line with the sector changes, potentially creating volatility, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper.  While many individual investors will still view Alphabet and Facebook as tech stocks, mutual funds have internal rules limiting how much they can invest across different sectors.  With Facebook and Alphabet shifted into the communications sector, fund managers will no longer have to choose between them and Apple or Microsoft (MSFT.O), or bets on chipmakers and cloud-computing, said Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Palfrey.   “And at the same time, an investor can go to the communications sector and overweight an internet services company against a traditional telecom company,” Palfrey said. “This is important for investors who have mandates to stay within certain parameters of a sector.”    Technology stocks have been top performers driving Wall Street’s gains in recent years, including Apple (AAPL.O), which currently makes up 16 percent of the S&P; 500 IT index .SPLRCT.   Apple will increase its weight in that index to 20 percent following the removal of No. 2 component Alphabet and Facebook, its fourth largest member.  The changes will also increase the weight of smaller tech companies.

In a reorganization spanning three sectors, none of the so-called FANG high-growth stocks - Facebook (FB.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - will be classified as technology companies, even though investors widely view them as the leaders of a tech rally that has powered the stock market higher in recent years.  On Sept. 24, S&P; will shift Alphabet, Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N), Paypal (PYPL.O) and videogame makers Electronic Arts (EA.O) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) from the S&P; 500 technology index to an expanded telecom group, renamed “Communications Services.”   Netflix, which like Amazon, is currently part of the consumer discretionary group, will also move to the expanded telecom group. Amazon will stay put in consumer discretionary.  The changes are part the largest-ever reorganization of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, an industry taxonomy widely used by investors. MSCI will adjust its indexes in November.   Meant to reflect the economy’s evolution, the overhaul of GICS will affect how mutual fund managers choose between stocks, and force passively managed sector funds to reallocate billions of dollars. Removing Alphabet and Facebook from technology indexes may lead investors to pay more attention to smaller, remaining technology companies.  “People will be able to get a clear look at the tech sector without being overwhelmed by these behemoths that really are media companies,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.   Exchange-traded funds that passively track indexes have about $89 billion invested in the technology sector, much of which will have to be reinvested to stay in line with the sector changes, potentially creating volatility, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper.

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the accounts identified on his company’s platform were part of two separate campaigns, the first from Iran with some ties to state-owned media, the second linked to sources that Washington has previously named as Russian military intelligence services.  “Such claims are ridiculous and are part and parcel of U.S. public calls for regime change in Iran, and are an abuse of social media platforms,” said Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for the Iranian mission to the United Nations.  The Kremlin rejected Facebook’s accusations. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow did not understand the basis for such statements and that they looked like “carbon copies” of previous allegations that Moscow has denied.  Global social media companies are seeking to guard against political interference on their platforms amid rising concerns about foreign attempts to disrupt the U.S. midterm elections in November.  The United States earlier this year indicted 13 Russians on charges they attempted to meddle in U.S. politics, but the alleged Iranian activity, exposed by cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc, suggests the problem may be more widespread.  “It really shows it’s not just Russia that engages in this type of activity,” Lee Foster, an information operations analyst with FireEye, told Reuters.  FireEye said the Iranian campaign used a network of fake news websites and fraudulent social media personas spread across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus and YouTube, to push  narratives in line with Tehran’s interests.  The activity was aimed at users in the United States, Britain, Latin America and the Middle East up to and through this month, FireEye said. It included “anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes,” as well as advocacy of policies favorable to Iran, such as the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal.      FireEye said the Iranian activity did not appear “dedicated” to influencing the upcoming election, though some of the posts aimed at U.S. users did adopt “left-leaning identities” and took stances against U.S. President Donald Trump.  That activity “could suggest a more active attempt to influence domestic U.S. political discourse” is forthcoming, Foster said, but “we just haven’t seen that yet.”  Facebook said the Russia-linked accounts it removed were engaged in “inauthentic behavior” related to politics in Syria and Ukraine. It said that activity did not appear to be linked to the Iranian campaign.  “These were distinct campaigns and we have not identified any link or coordination between them. However, they used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing,” the company said in a statement.  Facebook last month removed 32 pages and accounts tied to another misinformation campaign without describing its origins, but that U.S. lawmakers said likely had Russian involvement.  Microsoft said this week that hackers linked to the Russian government sought to steal email login credentials from U.S. politicians and think tanks, allegations the Russian Foreign Ministry described as a “witch-hunt.”  FireEye said the U.S.-focused Iranian activity ramped up just months after Trump took office, with websites and social media accounts posting memes and articles, some of which were apparently copied from legitimate U.S. and Iranian news outlets.   In some cases, the domains for the fake websites like “US Journal” and “Liberty Free Press” were registered years before the 2016 election, in 2014 and 2013, but most remained inactive until last year, FireEye said.  Arabic-language, Middle East-focused websites appear to be part of the same campaign, the company added.  The technology companies variously said they linked the accounts to Iran based on user phone numbers, email addresses, website registration records and the timing of account activity matching Iranian business hours.   FireEye expressed “moderate confidence” about the Iranian origins but said it has not been able to tie the accounts to a specific organization or individuals.   Hundreds of thousands of people followed one or more of the Facebook pages implicated in the campaign, Facebook said.  It shared examples of removed posts, including a cartoon depicting an Israeli soldier executing a Palestinian and a fake movie poster showing Trump embracing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Postings cited by FireEye expressed praise for U.S. politicians and other Twitter users who criticized the Trump administration’s decision in May to abandon the Iranian nuclear pact, under which Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear weapons program in exchange for the loosening of sanctions.  Some Twitter and Facebook accounts were designed to appear as if they belonged to real people in the United States, Britain and Canada, according to FireEye. The accounts used a combination of different hashtags to engage in U.S. culture, including “#lockhimup,” “#impeachtrump” and “notmypresident.”   Twitter, which called the effort “coordinated manipulation,” said it removed 284 accounts.  Facebook said it removed 254 pages and 392 accounts across its flagship platform as well as its Instagram service.   The accounts spent about $12,000 to advertise through Facebook and Instagram. Facebook said it had notified the U.S. Treasury and State departments of the purchases, which may violate sanctions.  Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, did not respond to a request to comment.

100,Vivian Manning-Schaffel,"Is it safe to post first day of school pictures — or any photo of your child — online? Child safety experts say there are some risks, but they can be mitigated if you follow some simple rules.",2018-08-28 19:47:00,nbc-news,What you need to know before posting those first-day-of-school photos,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/what-you-need-know-posting-those-first-day-school-photos-ncna904271,https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_35/2547226/180828-father-cell-phone-photo-son-se-142p_52fc32a645f17f87319abe5d30d6cf9f.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg," If youâre a parent or are friends with one right about now, your Facebook and Instagram feeds are likely clogged with an endless stream of proud back-to-school photos. Itâs practically become a rite of passage for parents to snap and post these photos. Even with all the hub bub around social media app security, you shouldnât expect much of a slowdown. As CNBC reports, social media apps Facebook and Instagram havenât exactly been hurt by the Cambridge Analytica data scandal â a survey of about 1,300 U.S. Facebook and Instagram users found that two-thirds of respondents were logged on at least as much as they were last year. And it was just reported that Facebook banned a quiz app amid concerns that data on as many as four million users may have been misused. Even so, with all this going on, is it really safe to post something as personal as images of our kids anymore? We asked a couple of tech safety experts their opinion and they say yes â and no. There are some risks, but parents can mitigate them with a little forethought. âWhether itâs posting back-to-school pictures or family vacation pictures, we should always be aware that weâre actively creating a digital brand for our kids without their input or permission. What may be cute, sweet or funny to us as adults may not be to our kids down the line, so we should always be cognizant of that. Of course, we also run the risk of giving out too much information, and that information ending up in the wrong hands,â says Katie Greer of KL Greer Consulting, a firm that educates schools, law enforcement agencies, large corporations and community organizations about the ins and outs of internet and technology safety. Whether itâs posting back-to-school pictures or family vacation pictures, we should always be aware that weâre actively creating a digital brand for our kids without their input or permission. What kind of information? For starters, your home or school address. âA photo that you take of your kids on your front stoop, in your neighborhood or by the school entrance may contain personally identifiable information, such as your street name, house number, last name or your kids' school's name,â says Caroline Knorr, Senior Parenting Editor at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization designed to help kids and parents navigate media and technology. âWhile the risk is fairly small, there are people with bad intentions â such as people looking to rip off photos to sell for stock photography, identity hackers, predators, or even sales people targeting parents â who troll social media platforms looking for any clues that could give them some way into your life,â she says. Before you know it, your personal photos can end up somewhere you least expect. âScreen shots, sharing, reposting, even innocuously, can mean these pictures unintentionally end up in places we never imagined,â says Greer. âSince there are so many users on social media, and technology moves so quickly, itâs often hard to contain posts that get out.â To do what you can to protect your back-to-school photos and your kids, keep these tips in mind: Thereâs no easier way to tell the world where you are, or were, than geotagging. âTagging your kids at their school allows those posts to come up in searches, so I always advise people not to tag locations, just reference them in a caption,â advises Greer. Make sure any sort of personal way of identifying you or your children â such as your address, your kidâs schoolâs name, or a uniform that might identify what school they go to, is out of sight in any photo you post. Both experts agree the first â and easiest â step to keep your photos away from potential interlopers is to simply adjust your privacy settings. Make them fairly restrictive â to either friends only, or friends of friends, says Knorr. Or, create a custom, closed group of close friends and share your back-to-school photos that way. Mind you, these settings arenât by any means foolproof. âMost important is to understand that privacy settings are a courtesy, NOT a guarantee,â says Greer. âTheyâre there to give users a bit more control of who has access to their information, but at any point in time this information can be shared, saved, hacked, etc., so thereâs no guarantee it wonât go elsewhere.â Most important is to understand that privacy settings are a courtesy, NOT a guarantee. âFacebook works by creating connections. The more connections someone has, the more data it generates, which Facebook and third parties can collect and monetize,â explains Knorr. âThe tag creates a link to the tagged user's profile and that increases their digital footprint on the platform. Your kid's online visibility will increase, as well with more links or tags going to his or her profile. The more visibility, the less control you have over your own online identity.â Fortunately, Facebook allows you to limit your tag settings. And donât forget to turn off facial recognition, which can also lead to increased visibility since it allows people to be tagged, even if the original poster doesn't know you personally, Knorr adds. Your kid is your business, but other kids are their parentsâ business. âItâs really hard in this 'sharing' world we live in to balance our excitement with othersâ expectations of privacy,â says Greer. âBefore you post, always ask permission and donât assume. Many parents of younger kids seem to be more and more against sharing any pictures or information about their kids.â Make sure you have a trusted group of followers, and that those followers are aware of your boundaries around sharing your posts. A well-intentioned, over-sharing aunt, uncle or grandparent may not be as on top of their privacy settings as you are, says Greer. So, when the first day of school comes, go ahead and tell your kids to strike a pose. They may not feel like smiling, but you can feel a little better about sharing whatever expression you get out of them. Want more tips like these?

101,Alexander Kacala,"Jamel Myles, 9, killed himself late last week, and his mother said the bullying he endured after coming out as gay led to his tragic end.",2018-08-28 14:10:54,nbc-news,"Mom said son, 9, killed himself after he was bullied for being gay",https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/mom-said-son-9-killed-himself-after-he-was-bullied-n904396,https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_35/2546836/leia_rochelle_pic_1_8b37a76063ed6e39505fa763b66912e1.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg," The mother of a 9-year-old boy said bullying he endured after coming out as gay led him to kill himself last week. Jamel Myles was a fourth-grade student at the Joe Shoemaker Elementary School in Denver. His mother, Leia Pierce, told The Denver Post that he came out as gay this summer and began wearing fake fingernails on Aug. 20, the first day of school. Pierce found her sonâs body on Thursday, just three days after school had started, and tried to revive him. He was pronounced dead at the Swedish Medical Center, according to a report from the Denver Office of the Medical Examiner. The manner of death, according to the report, was suicide and did not involve a firearm. Pierce, who told both the Denver Post and NBC's local Denver affiliate that her son was bullied for being gay, took to Facebook to express her pain and plead for an end to bullying. âI lost a reason to breathe ... my heart, my sunshine, my son... he was being bullied and i didnt know. Not till it was to late.. i wish i knew everything so i could've stopped this... i shouldn't be having to bury my son he is only 9,â Pierce wrote in a public Facebook post on Aug. 24, a day after her sonâs death. âI want justice for my son and the only way to get that is to touch peopleâs hearts and tell them if we love more it will be harder to hate,â Pierce wrote in another Facebook post. âI taught all my kids we are all the same and he treated people as equals because he was taught love.. so teach your kids love please.. stop bullying.â A day after Jamelâs death, Christine Fleming, the school principal, sent a letter to parents expressing ""extreme sadness"" over this ""unexpected loss for our school community."" ""Our thoughts are with the studentâs family at this time,"" Fleming said. ""We will continue to process this sad news as a school community.â Then on Monday, the district sent out a statement saying it is ""deeply committed to ensuring that all members of the school community are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status."" ""It is critical that our students receive all the supports they need to learn and thrive in a safe and welcoming environment. Our formal policies and practices reflect this commitment to ensuring that our LGBTQ+ students can pursue their education with dignity â from policies and training to prevent and stop bullying to formal policies and guidance materials that fully respect gender identity (including use of preferred pronouns and restrooms),"" the statement continued. Jane Clementi, co-founder of the Tyler Clement Foundation, which works to end bullying in schools, workplaces and faith communities, spoke out against the pervasiveness and dangers of bullying and harassment. It is named after her son, Tyler, who was gay and killed himself in 2010 after enduring online bullying. âOver and over again we see that vicious harassment can and does result in death,â Clementi told NBC News. âIt should not take the death of a child for us to do the right thing and treat every human being with respect, kindness and the dignity they deserve.â âAll adults, but especially, teachers, coaches and school administrators, must take action to protect the safety of its students,â Clementi said. âThe Tyler Clementi Foundation encourages all school districts to develop a plan to prevent bullying and stop this cruelty before it starts.â Clementi also said it is important for parents to âcreate a safe, encouraging and loving home environment for their children,â a space where they know they have âtheir parents' support to be who they were born to be, able to love who they were created to love.â Kristina Furia, the founder and executive director of both Emerge Wellness and Philadelphia LGBTQ Counseling, echoed Clementiâs advice to parents. âChildren are most likely to thrive when they have the physical and emotional space to learn about who they are and when they are empowered by supportive adults to embrace their various, unique attributes and identities,â Furia said. âItâs very difficult to say that parents or teachers should do X to ensure that more tragedies like this one donât keep happening, because it isnât about one thing that can be done or said when a child comes out to an adult,â Furia added. âInstead, it is about an ongoing environment of support and acceptance for the identity of every individual by both peers and adults.â In addition to families and schools, Clementi said religious organizations can also play in helping put an end to bullying â especially anti-gay bullying. âI would also encourage faith communities to stop perpetuating the misguided teachings and traditions of basis, dogma and discrimination that devalues the human spirit and causes so much pain and despair,â Clementi said. âI believe that love does not harm, and it should not be used to make someone feel broken, less than or separated from God because of who God created them to love. This would have a huge impact on our LGBTQ+ youth.â The Trevor Project offers multiple resources for LGBTQ youth in crisis, including the TrevorLifeline, a nationwide, 24/7 crisis and suicide lifeline: 1.866.488.7386.

  Lisa Sayers says her daughter, Samantha Sayers, moved from their Pennsylvania hometown to Seattle, Washington because she loves all the city has to offer.   âWe always went camping, but she fell in love with the west,â Lisa told Dateline. âShe loves nature and she loves that area.â   Samanthaâs free spirit also aligns with Seattle, her mother Lisa says.   âI have called her my little hippie in the last few years, because she is all about peace and love,â she said. âSheâs just got this light that comes from her.â   Lisa says her daughter has always been strong, as evidenced in how she dealt with having Alopecia, an autoimmune disease which results in hair loss. Samanthaâs developed between her junior and senior years of high school.   âShe tried to wear a wig in high school, but she hated it,â Lisa recalled. âShe said if she was going to be bald, she was going to do it her way.â   Lisa told Dateline about one particular act of strength in high school. Samantha addressed the entire student body one morning, explaining why her hair looked different and what Alopecia is.   âShe took her wig right off in front of everyone,â Lisa told Dateline. âShe has really empowered a lot of people through that journey.â   Samanthaâs boyfriend Kevin Dares, whom she met when she moved out west, says she also empowers him. They like to hike together and enjoy the nature surrounding their Seattle home.   On August 1, 2018, Samantha decided to go on a hike by herself, as she often does.   Samanthaâs mother Lisa told Dateline that for some reason, call it motherâs intuition, she was nervous about Samantha going on this particular hike. Samantha had planned to summit Vesper Peak in Washingtonâs North Cascades, a route sheâd taken before, and told family sheâd be gone from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.   The morning of the hike, Samantha said goodbye to her boyfriend Kevin and left for the trail. Kevin said that after Samantha left the house, he texted her to remind her to be careful.   âThe last text I sent her that morning was me saying âI know you donât need me to tell you this, but the terrain can be dangerous.â And she just replied something like, âI know. I love youâ,â Kevin told Dateline. He added that he was â110% sure heâd see her that night.â   Authorities would later learn that hikers saw Samantha on her way up Vesper Peak around mid-morning. Another hiker would later report eating lunch with Samantha on the trail, and seeing her again around 3:00 p.m. at the summit.   Samanthaâs mother Lisa told Dateline it only would have taken a couple of hours for Samantha to make the descent from the summit to her car. If she was at the summit at 3:00 p.m., Lisa said, she should have made it back to her car by 6:00 p.m. as she said she would.   But Samantha never made it back to her car. Her boyfriend, sitting at home waiting for Samanthaâs call, grew concerned.   âBy 7:00 or 7:15 p.m., I was on the road. The reason I jumped to it so quick, is because she is prepared. She sticks to her timeline,â Kevin told Dateline. He says he drove to the trail after picking up a cheap flashlight at a nearby gas station.   âI hit the mountain around 10:00 p.m. I didnât have any gear with me: It was a sad state of affairs,â Kevin said, adding that his flashlight broke a few hours later. He called 911 to report Samantha missing around 1:00 a.m.   Lisa, who lives across the country in Samanthaâs hometown of Girard, Pennsylvania, didnât find out her daughter hadnât returned from the hike until she woke up on August 2nd and saw that Kevin had posted on Facebook asking if anyone knew where Samantha was.   âI just lost it,â Lisa told Dateline, thinking back to when she first read the news. Lisa says âKevin was in panic mode,â and had been out searching the mountain with forest rangers, so she didnât find it odd that he hadnât contacted her first.   The Snohomish County Sheriffâs Office reports that more than a dozen agencies sent volunteers to search for Samantha, who they describe as an âexperienced day hiker.â After finding Samanthaâs car still parked at the trailhead, authorities brought in three K-9 teams to help scour the mountain.   âThe King County Search and Rescue is on scene this morning conducting an air search using FLIR (thermal imaging cameras),â the Snohomish County Sheriffâs Office said in a release the weekend after Samantha disappeared. âSNOHAWK1 conducted air search operations for 33 hours over the weekend including a FLIR search operation.â   Photos posted by the Sheriffâs office show âthe steep, rugged and complex terrain personnel and volunteers from more than a dozen other agencies are working inâ to find Samantha. Samanthaâs mother Lisa says that when she and Samanthaâs father Ron traveled to Washington a few days after their daughter vanished, she saw the dangerous mountainside herself.   âShe hikes hard. Sheâs a beast. People donât realize how rugged it is,â Lisa said. âThe paths are pretty wide but there are areas where there are cliffs.â   But Lisa trusts her daughterâs hiking skills and knows âshe wouldnât have done anything stupid.â   âPeople saw her go up. A gentleman spoke to her at the summit. But nobody ever saw her come down. Did she go off trail to go to the bathroom? Or because someone made her feel uncomfortable?â Lisa speculated to Dateline. âWe wonât know until we find her.â   âThe hard thing with not knowing is that it could be any situation,â Kevin echoed. âIt could be that she is stuck in a crevice, or she could have panicked and been on the move for several days. She could be so far outside the containment zone of Vesper Peak by now.â   Lisa says Kevin is out on the mountain every day, searching for Samantha.   âItâs hard being in the mountain for 26 days, you start to hear and see things and when the visibility goes and the cold sets in, it gets worse and you feel like you spend half of your time chasing ghosts,â Kevin said in an August 26 Facebook post. âIt also reminds me of just how difficult this task can be at times and makes me think on the countless others who have sacrificed both their bodies and their minds to our familyâ¦ We owe all of you, whether you have spent 1 day with us or 26, you have all made the greatest of differences and we are more than humbled and forever in your debt.â   âWe tell [Kevin] to take care of himself, because [Samantha] is going to need him to be strong when she returns,â Lisaâs mother told Dateline, adding that she tries to stay strong herself, with the goal of bringing Samantha home.   Samantha turned 28 on August 13, nearly two weeks after she disappeared. She already had and especially difficult birthday hike planned out for that day, her mother said.   âIt was the first time I didnât talk to her on her birthday. My husbandâs birthday was just one day before hers, and he refused to even acknowledge it. Weâre both just numb,â she said.   After more than three weeks of constantly looking for Samantha, authorities suspended search operations on August 23. The Snohomish County Sheriffâs Office reports that in those three weeks, search operations included 357 hours for air operations, 105 hours for drone operations, 82 hours for the Marine Unit to support search teams going into the search area from Spada Lake and 329 hours for Sheriffâs Office SAR personnel.   ""We have exhausted all leads and tips. We've interviewed all witnesses who have come forward. We have checked and double-checked the possible routes we believe Sam could have taken,"" Search and Rescue Sgt. John Adams said in a press release. ""If there was a place we thought she could get to, we put people there to look for Sam, often putting our volunteers and personnel at great risk due to the rugged, remote, and dangerous terrain.""   Lisa says that, although some people were angry at the investigatorsâ decision to suspend the search, she understands that âthey canât spend their entire budget on one person.â   But that doesnât mean Samanthaâs loved ones have stopped looking. âPeople have been stranded in the wilderness a lot longer and survived,â Lisa told Dateline. âUntil there is proof, my daughter is alive. We are going to keep searching.â   âWe have known this day was coming and have been making preparations for some time,"" Samanthaâs boyfriend Kevin told NBC station KING-5. â[Authorities] have gone above and beyond in the search for Sam and I will always be indebted to them for their efforts.â   Kevin added that search efforts are ongoing, as âvolunteer mountaineering groups are stepping up hard and covering a lot of ground.â Lisa said Kevin has also arranged for drones to fly through the hard-to-reach mountainsides where Samantha could be stuck.   âThe greatest thing we have had is the compassion of the community. We launched a massive social media campaign to get this information out there,â Kevin said. âWe have people who are scouring Facebook and Instagram for clues. And thatâs the way we have found a lot of the witnesses who saw her on the mountain that day.â   Kevin continued to say that the countless volunteers who have helped â donating everything from $10 to their own private helicopters â have helped restore his faith in humanity. He says he has seen the same love on the mountain that Sam exudes every day.   â[Sam] has love for all. She wants inclusion for all. It doesnât matter what you dress like, what you look like. Sheâs a very strong proponent for LGBT rights. Everything she pushed for was about fairness and love,â he added.   The Facebook group #FindSamSayers says she was last seen wearing dark gray pants and a maroon hoodie. She also had two hiking poles, a blue backpack, a beige sun hat and a dark gray wool beanie. Samantha is 5â8â tall, weighs about 125 lbs., has green eyes and is bald due to her Alopecia. She has a tattoo of a tree on her back and tattoos of stars on the side of her head, designed by her mother Lisa as a symbol of strength. If you have any information on Samanthaâs whereabouts, please call the Snohomish County Sheriffâs Office at (425) 388-3393.   If you have a missing friend or family member, send a private message to Dateline NBC on our Facebook page and tell us your story.

103,Brandy Zadrozny,Conspiracy theorists have been targeting private businesses and individuals with harassment campaigns and accusations of being involved with child-sex trafficking rings.,2018-08-27 17:57:25,nbc-news,Secret message board drives 'pizzagate'-style harassment campaign of small businesses,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/secret-message-board-drives-pizzagate-style-harassment-campaign-small-businesses-n903696,https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_35/2545641/180827-comet-ping-pong-pizzagate-njs-1342_89921bb743c382ca2b5e358c084e8487.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg," In January, Andrew Richmond, a co-founder of a Toronto-based chain of ice cream shops called Sweet Jesus, started receiving strange online comments and phone calls. Conspiracy theorists littered the Instagram and Facebook accounts of Sweet Jesus with accusations and menacing comments, pointing to the chainâs name, brand iconography and advertising featuring children. They posted the shopâs advertisements to their own social media accounts and tagged them #PedoGate. Others took their campaign offline, calling the companyâs shops and threatening employees. âPeople were saying that we were pedophiles and the Illuminati,â Richmond said. âI wish I were part of the Illuminati. Donât they run the world? Iâm just selling ice cream.â The worst of it was over within a week, Richmond said. âWe were willing to say who we are and what we stand for, that itâs innocent,â Richmond said. âI realized we were winning the battle of reasonableness here.â Sweet Jesus isnât the only business that has been the target of an online conspiracy theory. Voodoo Doughnut, a popular chain based in Portland, Oregon, has received similar calls in recent weeks. âTheyâre very persistent,â said Eamon Monaghan, a manager at the companyâs downtown Portland store, adding that calls were coming in hourly claiming, âwe know what is happening at your place.â âWeâre trying to firmly but politely say this isnât a thing and carry on with our business and ignore it,â Monaghan said. The harassment comes from a group of fervent online conspiracists who have been targeting private businesses and individuals with harassment campaigns and accusations of being involved with child-sex trafficking rings. Sparked by a video posted on a popular YouTube conspiracy channel, the group, whose members are also largely followers of the Qanon conspiracy theory, has flooded Voodooâs Instagram and Facebook posts and left Yelp reviews accusing the owners of child sex trafficking. Last week, the chainâs original Portland outpost received more calls from conspiracy theorists than customers ordering doughnuts, Monaghan said. The group is fueled in part by a website called Big League Politics, a far-right media outlet that often publishes conspiracy content and has been used to raise funds for prominent Republican politicians. Some of the websiteâs stories appear to be sourced from a secret message board created by a Big League Politics staffer, in which members concoct elaborate, pedophilia-based conspiracy theories they hope will be published to a wider audience. The harassment campaigns highlight how conspiracy theories that form in deep corners of the internet can have real-world consequences. The same theory that led conspiracists to Sweet Jesus and Voodoo Doughnut previously focused on Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizza shop where a man fired a rifle in 2016 during a ""self-investigation"" of online rumors that a child-sex ring was being run out of its basement. The shop has no basement. Monaghan said he refers callers to the Portland Police Department. Sgt. Chris Burley, a department spokesman, said that âan enormousâ number of emails and calls had been made to the department asking why they arenât investigating Voodoo Doughnut. Burley said a detective had looked into the situation but that the so-called whistleblower, who made the allegations against Voodoo Doughnut in the widely shared video that was ultimately deleted by YouTube, failed to cooperate. âThe lead investigator has repeatedly attempted to contact the person who made these allegations and has not heard back,â Burley said. âWe take these allegations seriously, but when the complainant wonât come forward with information, itâs difficult for us to continue.â âBased on what we have seen, there is no information to suggest that any of the allegations against Voodoo are credible,â the sergeant said. The baseless allegations are being lobbed daily by self-described âpatriot researchers."" Their harassment of Voodoo Doughnut and Sweet Jesus are just part of a larger war â waged on Twitter and in private groups on Facebook and Discord, a gaming-focused online chat program â against the politicians, celebrities and businesses they claim are part of a global conspiracy to harm children. Their paranoia is partly fueled by Big League Politics, which has published articles that glorify the anonymous peddlers of the Qanon conspiracy theory and promote unfounded allegations that the Democratic National Committee had ordered and covered up the 2016 murder of staffer Seth Rich. Run by former Breitbart News reporter Patrick Howley, who often writes the websiteâs most conspiracy-oriented content, Big League Politics has amassed a readership that prominent Republicans and their supporters have increasingly found attractive. Among the groups and GOP politicians that have used the Big League Politics email list to fundraise this year are the National Republican Congressional Committee; House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana; Rep. Devin Nunes of California; and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. When reached for comment, spokespeople for Scalise and Cruz said their campaigns would no longer work with Big League Politics and would return any money raised with the outlet. The Nunes campaign and the NRCC did not respond to a request for comment. Big League Politics writer Haley Kennington, who posts several stories a day on the site, appears to source some of her stories from a secret message board she created in July dubbed âPedo Takedown Crew,â which was recently discovered by NBC News. A staff writer for Big League Politics since May, Kennington often covers general pro-Trump news items, but has increasingly focused on a more specific beat â writing stories about what she calls âpedophilia-relatedâ social media posts from liberal-leaning celebrities. On the message board, hosted on the video game-focused social media network Discord, Kennington and some 40 self-described âresearchersâ crowdsource what they claim are pedophilia investigations. Members of the group have shared maps of âunderground tunnelsâ that they speculate run between elementary schools and small businesses for child sex trafficking. Kennington has asked her team to investigate Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and BeyoncÃ©, among others. Kennington recruited members to her group by posting invitations in private Qanon chatrooms, according to Discord logs viewed by NBC News. âNeed help digging,â she wrote to her new group members in July. âDrop what you can find here. Links to any Nambla, pedo/child trafficking/organizations, $, connections. You know what to do.â At Kenningtonâs request, others in the group have posted maps of Voodoo Doughnut locations alongside the cityâs plumbing system, local schools, public transit network, and airports, suggesting a possible method of smuggling children in or out of the sweets shop. âSmall submarines arent (sic) out of the realm of possibility,â offered one member. Kennington initially declined to speak to a reporter on the phone, but responded to emails by requesting a list of questions that she said she would answer. She did not reply to those questions. On Tuesday, Kennington asked on Twitter whether NBC News was âCompliantâ or âInvolvedâ in pedophilia. When asked about Kenningtonâs âPedo Takedown Crewâ group, Howley, the editor-in-chief of Big League Politics, called the message board a âresearch operation,â but said he hadnât heard of the group until NBC News asked about it. âI think you are attacking a research community that I havenât heard about to defend the doughnut shop. Have you been to the doughnut shop?â Howley said. âAre you associated with [Voodoo Doughnut] in some way?â After an NBC News inquiry into the channel, Kennington kicked out half of her members. While it is unclear whether the channel is still operating, as of Monday, the discussions remained active, with various users posting links and maps associated with Voodoo Doughnutâs Portland location. On Aug. 9, Discord user Zach1616 posted a note to the Voodoo Doughnut channel of Pedo Takedown Crew. âTime for a roadtrip lol,â the message reads. Â© 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL",0.103,0.83,0.067,-0.9955

Investigators working for the U.N.'s top human rights body said the countryâs military carried out mass killings and gang rapes against the ethnic minority with âgenocidal intent.â Also on Monday, Facebook announced it was removing some Myanmar military leaders from its platform âincluding some of those identified in the U.N. report. The U.N. investigators took the unusual step of identifying the commander-in-chief and five generals by name to pinpoint the main alleged perpetrators of deadly, systematic crimes against the ethnic minority. The civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi has allowed hate speech to thrive, destroyed documents and failed to protect minorities from crimes against humanity and war crimes by the army, they concluded. In doing so, it âcontributed to the commission of atrocity crimes,â their report said. The investigators compiled hundreds of accounts of crimes including gang rape, the torching of hundreds of villages, enslavement, and killings of children. They said hatred against Rohingya was still being incited among Facebook users in Myanmar. âThe role of social media is significant,â it said. âFacebook has been a useful instrument for those seeking to spread hate, in a context where for most users Facebook is the Internet. âAlthough improved in recent months, Facebookâs response has been slow and ineffective. The extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discrimination and violence must be independently and thoroughly examined.â Facebook enjoys sudden and overwhelming dominance in Myanmar, where basic freedoms such as internet access were banned by a military-led regime until 2014. The subsequent rapid rush to adopt smartphones, coupled with a lack of established media, has led to a wave of fake news sites and hate speech â a problem acknowledged by the social media giant itself. âWe continue to work to prevent the misuse of Facebook in Myanmar,â it said in a blog post. ""This is a huge responsibility given so many people there rely on Facebook for information â more so than in almost any other country given the nascent state of the news media and the recent rapid adoption of mobile phones.â It said: ""We're removing a total of 18 Facebook accounts, one Instagram account and 52 Facebook Pages, followed by almost 12 million people. While we were too slow to act, weâre now making progress."" Government troops launched a brutal crackdown in Myanmar in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on police posts and a military base. Some 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. The U.N. investigators also faulted Aung San Suu Kyi for not using her role as head of Myanmar's government, nor her ""moral authority"" â she is a Nobel peace prize laureate â to stop the deadly violence.

105,Justin Hendrix,Misinformation and polarization are forms of pollution exacerbated by social media business models — and social media companies should pay to clean it up.,2018-08-24 21:12:00,nbc-news,It's time for Big Tech to pay for the pollution it creates,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/facebook-youtube-twitter-cannot-rely-outsiders-police-misinformation-their-own-ncna902671,https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_34/2537541/180820-jack-dorsey-se-534p_613b2d02f25a9f7f7b5f1094aa14a0d1.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg," Justin Hendrix is Executive Director of NYC Media Lab, a consortium of universities and media companies exploring emerging media technology. NYC Media Labâs membership includes NBCUniversal. Opinions expressed here are entirely his own. Follow him on Twitter (@justinhendrix). The ongoing controversy over Twitterâs decision not to permanently ban Infowars extremist Alex Jones following similar moves by companies such as Apple and Facebook landed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in front of NBCâs Lester Holt last week. Dorsey attempted to explain himself on a variety of thorny questions involving free speech and what he refers to as âsensationalistâ and âde-humanizingâ use of his platform, on which misinformation and harassment continues to be a serious problem. One particular exchange between Holt and Dorsey highlighted a significant flaw in the logic of social media executives confronting misinformation: that it is the job of journalists to debunk misinformation, and not the responsibility of platforms. In tweets responding to the Infowars controversy, Dorsey stated that âaccounts like Jones' can often sensationalize issues and spread unsubstantiated rumors, so itâs critical journalists document, validate, and refute such information directly so people can form their own opinions. This is what serves the public conversation best.â Holt questioned Dorsey on this point: âYou put the onus on journalists to police some of the misinformation thatâs put out there, is that fair?â In reply, Dorsey admitted to Holt: âNo I donât believe itâs completely fair. I went a little too far in that push.â We didnât suspend Alex Jones or Infowars yesterday. We know thatâs hard for many but the reason is simple: he hasnât violated our rules. Weâll enforce if he does. And weâll continue to promote a healthy conversational environment by ensuring tweets arenât artificially amplified. While Dorsey appeared chastened, the idea that it is someone elseâs job to confront the problem is core to the way social media companies look at the ongoing challenges of misinformation and online toxicity. Dorseyâs initial statement betrayed the truth: Powerful companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter increasingly rely on the efforts of others to address the spread of misinformation on their platforms. And itâs not just journalists they hope to conscript into the battle. Consider YouTubeâs announcement earlier this year that it would rely on Wikipedia to address conspiracy theories (the company failed to inform Wikipedia before it made this announcement), or Facebookâs seeming reliance on a loose network of volunteers to spot fake accounts and debunk misinformation its own teams miss.  Issues of misinformation and online toxicity are challenging nations across the globe, and the reality is that these problems are too big for these companies to address. Evidence is piling up on the real world implications. Thatâs why itâs time to think about radical solutions. Hereâs one: Governments should place levies on social media company profits to pay for measures that will address the externalities they produce. This idea is not new. Carbon taxes are a good corollary. Governments across the globe have come to the conclusion that the emission of harmful greenhouse gases can be quantified, and companies producing these harmful emissions should be pay for their remediation. Why not \ treat the externalities created by social media companies as pollution; cleaning up this pollution can and should be paid for by the companies that create it. Such a solution has already been proposed in the United Kingdom, where a parliamentary committee looking at the problems of misinformation suggested levies as a mechanism to expand the function of Britainâs watchdog agency, the Information Commissionerâs Office, and to pay for digital literacy campaigns. Expanding the funding of necessary oversight and programs to help citizens of all ages cope with the overload of information and think critically about the health effects of social media consumption seems fair. After all, these companies have been allowed by democracies to achieve enormous market dominance and systemic importance. Expanding the funding of necessary oversight and programs to help citizens of all ages cope with the overload of information and think critically about the health effects of social media consumption seems fair. What else might such levies fund? Perhaps the social media companies should be required to create trusts that fund a massive injection of capital into journalism. Google has voluntarily committed $300 million to such efforts to some good effect; what would a multiple of that number look like? Itâs a rounding error at one level: Googleâs parent company, Alphabet, saw revenues of $111 billion in 2017. Facebook saw net income of nearly $16 billion in 2017 on revenues of $40 billion. Meanwhile, the combined advertising and circulation revenues of the entire newspaper industry in the United States in 2017 was $27.5 billion, a number that has shrunk precipitously even as the platforms continue to grow. âA strong news industry is also critical to building an informed community,â Mark Zuckerberg wrote last year. âGiving people a voice is not enough without having people dedicated to uncovering new information and analyzing it.â Sounds good â but perhaps democracies ought not rely on Zuckerbergâs limited generosity, and instead put some serious demands on his company. âAddressing these diseconomies of scale- negative externalities borne by users and society as a result of the size of these platforms- represents a priority for technology policy in the 21st century,â Sen. Mark Warner wrote in a recent technology policy paper. These companies cannot address the problems they have created alone â now is the time to think about how to capitalize solutions at scale. Whether we are able to engage with our fellow citizens in a healthy information environment may well determine the fate of our democracy.

Some Reddit users were repeatedly posting divisive political rhetoric from a group of obscure news websites. That effort led a Reddit moderator from California named Alex Brown and a small team of volunteers to investigate. Using publicly available data about who started the news websites, they were able to find evidence of a wide-ranging propaganda network across the social news site with ties to Iran. Brown and other amateur researchers notified Reddit, but the website, the fifth-most visited in the U.S., according to data from Amazonâs Alexa analytics, did not respond. On Tuesday, Facebook and Twitter announced that the websites that Brown had tracked could be traced back to Iran state media, and purged the accounts from their service. ""I tried going to the admins [Reddit's word for paid employees],â Brown said. âI told them about this [eight] days ago. These are hard examples of literal fake news, with clear evidence pointing to the Iranian government."" ""If theyâre not going to do jack then Iâm coming to the media and going to the government. They are attempting to undermine our democracy by posting propaganda."" In total, there were more than two dozen times that the group of Reddit power users, led by Brown, notified Reddit employees of the Iranian disinformation operation, starting in July 2017, according to correspondence viewed by NBC News. The two most recent messages identifying Iranian propaganda to Reddit's paid administrators came on Aug. 16 and 18, just days before Facebook's pulldown. Brown and other volunteers used a combination of website identification data, called WHOIS data, and tracked similar domain-name registrars and IP addresses to determine the origins of the websites he suspected of being part of a propaganda campaign, which frequently posted fabricated news stories to Reddit. He noted a considerable uptick in both new propaganda accounts and content pushed by the Iranian troll farm, saying they ""kicked it into high gear"" since August 2017. Removing propaganda from Reddit may prove tougher than doing so on most other sites. The website has no explicit rule against state-sponsored propaganda, though users who push propaganda are sometimes banned for breaking rules against spamming â or repeatedly posting links to one website or network of websites. But the website does have volunteer moderators who run all of its communities, many of whom actively stop efforts to manipulate its system. Reddit has in recent weeks begun to delete some of the user accounts that were found to have been pushing the Iranian websites. Reddit provided a statement to NBC News about the propaganda campaigns waged on its site. ""We are aware of recent reports of malicious actors on social platforms. We are investigating our own site and, as we have done previously, will be transparent with our findings,â a Reddit spokesperson said. A Reddit source told NBC News that it is now considering developing a program that will allow researchers like Brown, who have correctly identified targeted spam campaigns on the platform in the past, to directly communicate with site administrators. Brown's data set included the websites pulled down by Facebook this week, plus dozens of others. He said a Reddit employee reached out to him to apologize on Thursday after news of the propaganda effort led to a clean-up effort across Facebook, Twitter and Google. The note said that the company ""appreciates your thoroughness"" and that ""you may not have gotten responses to your recent reports from us and thatâs not cool."" Brown said he's thankful for the response he received, but still doesn't think Reddit, or any company that controls key web infrastructure like web hosting or social media companies, is doing enough. ""Itâs a lot of peopleâs faults,â Brown said. âThere have been a lot of failures across the internet that led to this point.â Iran's propaganda operation most effectively targeted the /r/WorldNews community, the siteâs third-largest subreddit with more than 19 million subscribers, and also had recent success pushing content to smaller Reddit groups. The disinformation operation drew from the same playbook as the Kremlinâs 2016 foreign influence campaign, posing as members of both the American right and left to highlight Iranian government interests. Iranian imposter content on the anti-Trump subreddits like r/MarchAgainstTrump gained considerable traction. Posts amplified by the disinformation effort saw the second-most traction in the Spanish-language subreddit r/podemos, a community for a left-wing political party in Spain. ""It was pretty easy to tell what the angle was here: pro-Palestine, pro-Iran, anti-Israel, generic anti-America sentiment or articles about exposing the evils of the West,"" Brown said. Josh Russell, an independent researcher who studies misinformation campaigns, found that some Reddit users pushed hundreds of posts from Iranian websites. I pulled the data for these domains on reddit. libertyfrontpress[.]cominstitutomanquehue[.]orgcriticschronicle[.]comusjournal[.]usbritishleft[.]comrpfront[.]comTop authors and Top subreddits. pic.twitter.com/OXOCacnLze Russell also noted that the tone of some posts had shifted recently toward staunchly backing anti-Trump politicians since the administrationâs withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. One user who mostly pushed content from the Iranian sites even created a fledgling community devoted to Democratic House nominee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called r/ocasio_cortez, that failed to take off. Users on Reddit seeking to report spam content, suicide and terror threats, or other banned content like revenge porn, typically have to go through an outdated system in which they message a group of moderators on a now-defunct Reddit community called r/reddit.com. Years ago, Brown sometimes received responses for flagging the spam campaigns this way, but he had been ignored by Reddit administrators since the disinformation ramped up. As a moderator of some communities, he started noticing fake information, including fabricated quotes, posted in highly ranked news articles in some of the subreddits he oversaw. In some cases, he said, he reached out to activists who were quoted in articles who told him, ""we have never heard of that site before and we didn't talk to them, either."" ""That's when I knew there was an extremely high-volume racket going on,"" he said. Brown worked with Russell, an Indiana-based researcher who provided news organizations with datasets over the last year to pinpoint Russian propaganda on Reddit and Twitter, in identifying some of the Iranian campaigns. Both Brown and Russell said the groups share many similarities, including smaller website-hosting providers and domain registrars, which helped them zero in on the perpetrators. Russell said he believes Reddit needs to be more proactive about foreign powers looking to use its site to wage an information war. ""I mean we are talking about the fifth-or-so most-visited site on the internet here,â Russell said. âTo know that users who want to help them keep disinformation, especially foreign influence campaigns, off the platform have been ignored is angering to say the least.â ""But then for them to say it was 'just spam' is complete BS.""

107,"Jason Abbruzzese, David Ingram",The announcement comes two days after Facebook and Twitter both announced that they had found evidence of an Iran-based effort to push political content,2018-08-23 18:27:00,nbc-news,"Iran's disinformation campaign extended to YouTube, Google says",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/iran-s-disinformation-campaign-extended-youtube-google-says-n903241,https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_09/2342121/180226-youtube-logo-njs-1205p_9e86b76428fc425c29c840ea5fea9bbc.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg," Iran's covert social media-based propaganda campaign extended to Google and its video platform YouTube, the company said Thursday. Google said that it had removed 58 accounts on its various services that it found had connections to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Iran's state media organization. The U.S. blacklisted IRIB in 2013 as part of its efforts to force the country to stop its nuclear program. The search company is at least the third Silicon Valley firm this week to say it had found evidence of an Iran-based effort to use fake names to push political content to people in the U.S. and other countries. Facebook and Twitter said Tuesday that they had removed such accounts. Google said it had used technical analysis including IP addresses, metadata and domain ownership to tie the accounts to Iran and that the operation had been running since at least January 2017. The Iranian effort on YouTube appeared to be relatively small, involving 39 YouTube channels with fewer than 14,000 total U.S. views, the company said. Google also removed six accounts from its blogging platform and 13 Google+ accounts. Google credited cybersecurity company FireEye with helping to identify the Iranian operation. The company, which also advised Facebook and Twitter, released its full report on the Iranian operation. Kent Walker, senior vice president of global affairs at Google, wrote in a blog post that the company continued to hunt for state-based hacking and disinformation efforts. ""The state-sponsored phishing attacks, and the actors associated with the IRIB that weâve described above, are clearly not the only state-sponsored actors at work on the Internet,"" Walker wrote. Walker said Google had continued to look for activity from Russia's Internet Research Agency, and that the company has removed 42 YouTube channels related to the organization since it's initial action. Iran this week called the accusations by tech companies âridiculous.â Russia has long denied using social media to try to sway Americans. Iranâs use of a social media playbook also taken up by Russia shows how easy it is for perhaps any country to spread state-backed propaganda abroad under fake names, security analysts said this week.

The social media company said Wednesday it took action against the myPersonality app because its creators refused an inspection, and over worries that data on as many as 4 million users may have been misused. Facebook is particularly vexed about anything relating to the misuse of data following the Cambridge Analytica scandal earlier this year. Allegations that political consultancy used personal information harvested from 87 million Facebook accounts have seriously dented the company's reputation as well as its stock market value. Facebook has investigated thousands of apps and suspended more than 400 apps over data sharing concerns. Facebook said it moved to ban the myPersonality app after it found user information was shared with researchers and companies ""with only limited protections in place."" The company said it would notify the app's users that their data may have been misused. It's only the second time Facebook has banned an app, after it blocked one linked to Cambridge Analytica. It said myPersonality was ""mainly active"" prior to 2012, and it wasn't clear why Facebook was taking action now. The app was created in 2007 by researcher David Stillwell and allowed users to take a personality questionnaire and get feedback on the results. ""There was no misuse of personal data,"" Stillwell said in a statement, adding that ""this ban appears to be purely cosmetic."" Stillwell said users gave their consent and the app's data was fully anonymized before it was used for academic research. He also rejected Facebook's assertion that he refused to submit to an audit, saying the company knows he is willing to provide information. Separately, Facebook also removed its Onavo Protect virtual private network app from Apple's store after the iPhone maker brought in tighter data security rules for applications. Onavo Protect could no longer be found on Apple's store on Thursday but was still available on the Google Play store for Android phones. Facebook acquired Onavo, an Israeli company, in 2013. Its VPN software is aimed at helping users secure their personal information over public Wifi networks and alerting them when apps use too much data. But the company also said that it may collect users' mobile data traffic and that aroused concerns about privacy. ""We've always been clear when people download Onavo about the information that is collected and how it is used,"" Facebook said in a statement. ""As a developer on Apple's platform we follow the rules they've put in place,"" referring to Apple's revised app store guidelines released in June. Among the changes is a new section on data security requiring developers to ""implement appropriate security measures to ensure proper handling of user information.""

All it takes is a time-tested, publicly available playbook â and the will to try. That is the lesson security analysts said theyâre drawing after the disclosure this week by Facebook that Iran had for years succeeded in using the social network for propaganda purposes, much as Russia has allegedly done. Since 2011, people linked to Iranian state media had set up Facebook pages with fake names and used them to blast out divisive messages aimed at other countries, including the United States and Britain, Facebook said on Tuesday. Facebook added that it had removed hundreds of the Iranian-linked pages, and in a similar action, Twitter said it had taken down hundreds more accounts on its service. âIt demonstrates that there are actors out there beyond Russia who perceive there to be value in pursuing these kinds of activities,â said Lee Foster, a manager at private security firm FireEye, which tipped off Facebook to part of the Iranian network. Russia popularized the idea that social media networks could be easily used for information warfare, after its agents spread propaganda on Facebook in particular in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to U.S. intelligence agencies and an indictment this year of Russian nationals. There is no allegation that Iranians and Russians were working together, and Facebook has ramped up its spending on security measures to try to root out what it calls âinformation operationsâ by governments. But just about any nation can use the same playbook, and several may already be veterans at it, experts said. âThereâs nothing preventing anyone else from adopting that, and you look at the political situation out there and itâs ripe to be exploited,â said Ben West, a senior analyst at Stratfor Threat Lens. âThe fault lines are ripe to be exploited.â The only thing holding countries back, Foster said, is whether a covert social media operation is worth the effort and potential blowback. âWhat it comes down to is a political decision as to whether they see any value in doing so,â he said. Russia has denied meddling on social media, and Iran this week called the accusations against it absurd, according to Reuters. Similar allegations against Iran go back years. In 2014, cyber intelligence firm iSight Partners said it had uncovered an espionage campaign by Iranian hackers that included fake social networking accounts and a fake news website. The similarities between what Iran and Russia did on social media are difficult to miss, according to samples released by Facebook and by U.S. lawmakers. Both set up social media accounts with vague names that disguised who was behind them. Iranians used names such as âThe British Leftâ or âLiberty Front Press,â while Russians had pages such as âBorn Liberalâ and âBlacktivists.â They tried their hands at buying ads, with the Iranians spending around $12,000, apparently much less than the $100,000 that Facebook says Russians spent. And they posted commentary on inflammatory racial and ethnic subjects. While the Russians posted in the United States about the Ku Klux Klan and the Confederate flag, the Iranians boosted Scottish independence and mocked President Donald Trumpâs embrace of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Some posts latched onto viral internet memes, such as a photo of former first lady Michelle Obama holding up a sheet of paper doctored with a joke. âAn immigrant took my job,â the sheet reads in a post by the Iranians, a reference to Trumpâs Slovenia-born wife Melania. âIf youâre running information operations, it would be weird not to jump on viral content and use it for your own purposes,â said Graham Brookie, director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, a think tank that has partnered with Facebook to analyze disinformation campaigns. One difference is that there is no allegation Iran tried to sway an election; Russians supported Trumpâs campaign in 2016 and disparaged his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, according to an indictment brought by U.S. prosecutors. Lawmakers seized on the similarities between the alleged Iranian and Russian operations to urge the Trump administration to do more to stop foreign governments from turning social media networks into battlegrounds. âThe Kremlin playbook of meddling now used by Iran. By failing to deter Russia, Trump paved the way for every US adversary to interfere in our democracy. Time for Congress to act!â Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a tweet. European lawmakers also expressed alarm that Iranians targeted Britain. âWe need to do more to protect our elections and tackle the online challenges to elections head on,â said Vera Jourova, a European commissioner who has been involved in writing election regulations for the region, the New York Times reported. But Foster, of FireEye, said that even if U.S. and European authorities are able to build up their defenses, social media battles may still rage in other parts of the world. A regional conflict between small countries, for example, may be hard to spot, he said. âIt takes dedicating resources to investigate the activity and unmask the campaigns,â Foster said. âYou have to be actively looking for them.â Â© 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL",0.077,0.864,0.059,-0.9351

She’ll join in the fall from Facebook, where she’s been serving as the social media giantâs head of news products. In her new role, Hardiman will focus on digital consumer revenue, audience experience and product strategy, leading The Atlantic’s product, engineering, data and growth teams. âI’ve always been a news person,â Hardiman said in a Facebook post. âIt’s my passion during the workday and my guilty pleasure on nights and weekends. It’s why I spent a decade at The Times before coming to Facebook to help tackle some of the company’s formidable news challenges, and it’s why I’m now joining The Atlantic at a unique moment in its history.â Hardiman joined Facebook in 2016, just as criticism against the platform for its role in spreading âfake newsâ began to spread like wildfire. She was promoted to lead its news efforts on the product side in May 2017. Before that, she spent more than a decade at The New York Times, completing her tenure as vice president of news products. Alex Hardiman, former VP of product at The NY Times, will take the lead on Facebook’s news products  âHer leadership positions at both Facebook and The New York Times give her an unrivaled perspective on digital media, and her audience-first focus will sharpen the appeal of our work,â The Atlantic president Bob Cohn said in a statement. âAll this will serve us extremely well as we aggressively expand our ambitions for 2019 and beyond.â Â Â  At Facebook, Hardiman was involved in a variety of projects, including removing the trending feature and launching Facebook Watch. Both initiatives were part of a greater effort to remove fake news from the site and provide new avenues for more reliable news from trusted sources. “Alex is a true leader who built a fantastic team,” a representative from Facebook told me. “She helped develop a framework and key news products for both people on Facebook and publishers. We wish her nothing but the best at The Atlantic.” Here’s Hardiman’s full statement: A Personal Update I have some news to share: after two deeply gratifying years at Facebook, I’ve decided to leave and join The Atlantic in the fall. I’ve always been a news person. It’s my passion during the workday and my guilty pleasure on nights and weekends. It’s why I spent a decade at The Times before coming to Facebook to help tackle some of the company’s formidable news challenges, and it’s why I’m now joining The Atlantic at a unique moment in its history. Facebook has given me so many things for which I’m profoundly grateful: wildly talented colleagues, great relationships with news organizations that are reinventing their future, and deep humility for the difficulty of solving nuanced problems at Facebook’s scale. Facebook has a long way to go, but there’s important progress being made to rebuild trust with consumers and publishers. The people behind the scenes work like crazy to make that happen and they often fly under the radar, but you can read more about some of them here:Â https://www.cnet.com/â¦/the-cure-for-facebooks-fake-news-inâ¦/. I’m proud of the News team’s mission-driven ethos and I couldn’t be more confident and optimistic about its future. It therefore required an extraordinary opportunity to compel me to move on. The Atlantic has always been a part of my life when things got complicated. When I was conflicted about how to pursue professional ambition and motherhood at the same time, I found Anne Marie Slaughter’s perspective to be the most refreshing and relatable take on the issue. When I was trying to make sense of President Obama’s foreign policy, Jeffrey Goldberg’s reporting brought radical clarity and honesty to my understanding of America. Since before the Civil War, The Atlantic has consistently defined the most ambitious and contentious ideas of the moment. In today’s political and social climate, its role has never been more vital. So when I met with The Atlantic and Emerson Collective teams to learn about the next phase of investment and growth, I already knew how much of a privilege it would be to join them. In my new role, I’ll be partnering with teams across The Atlantic to create digital products that people love, grow the company’s consumer revenue line, and transform The Atlantic from a media-centric organization to a leader in media and product. After having built products with hundreds of news organizations at Facebook from the outside, I’m particularly excited to return to tackle these opportunities with The Atlantic from within. Facebook friends: thank you for everything. I’ve learned so much from you and have an unwavering appreciation for all that you do to better serve the people and publishers who use your products. Future Atlantic colleagues: I can’t wait to get to work and join you on this important mission. Thank you for having me.",0.041,0.785,0.174,0.9989

Earlier this month, Facebook  locked down its API to prevent third-party apps from being able to post to profiles as the logged-in user, and Twitter was one of those apps impacted by the change. However, the changes to Facebook’s API would not have mass deleted all of users’ cross-posted Tweets. It should have only prevented Twitter  users from continuing to automatically post from Twitter to their Facebook profile or business page. But Twitter,  for whatever reason – an accident, one would hope – requested its Facebook app be deleted. This resulted in removals of all the content that had been cross-posted by Twitter to Facebook being also deleted from users’ profiles. Facebook was in touch with Twitter since then, and received permission to have the app re-enabled. (Though it took longer than expected – Twitter was made aware of the problem early in the evening on Tuesday but it wasn’t until the wee hours of the morning on Wednesday that Facebook confirmed it was restoring the content – which means they received permission from Twitter to do so. Obviously, Facebook can’t just turn on a third-party app again after the developer says to take it down – it had to ask. Twitter, we understand, didn’t give Facebook immediate permission to fix the problem. Maybe it’s still mad about the whole cross-posting thing being turned off?) While, technically speaking, the error is on Twitter’s side here, Facebook probably should have had some kind of warning in place to alert the app developers – whomever they may be – of the consequences of their decisions. That is, deleting their app would also delete all the content shared through it over the years. Many Twitter users had heavily relied on the cross-posting feature to maintain their presence on Facebook and continue their discussions with a new audience. The deletions meant they lost years’ worth of Facebook posts and conversations, in many cases. Facebook says it has restored all the removed content, a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email around 1:20 AM ET on Wednesday. All impacted users should be able to see their cross-posts tweets and their discussions again.  ",0.061,0.889,0.049,-0.7808

The company has continued to add more social features to Watch over the past year, including participatory viewing experiences like Watch Parties, Premiers, and those with audience involvement, like an HQ Trivia competitor, Confetti, built on the new gameshow platform. Watch also offers basic tools for discovery, saving videos for later viewing, and lets users customize a feed of videos from Facebook Pages they follow. Along with international availability, Facebook is introducing “Ad Breaks” to more publishers. These can be either mid-roll or pre-roll ads, or images below the video. Publishers can either insert the ads themselves or use Facebook’s automated ad insertion features. Facebook says 70+ percent of mid-roll ads are viewed to completion. Ad Breaks are now offered to creators who publish 3-minute videos that generate over 30,000 1-minute views in total over the past 2 months; who have 10,000 Facebook followers or more; who are in a supported country; and who meet other eligibility criteria. Supported countries today includeÂ the U.S., UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Next month, that list will expand to include Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, The Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Thailand, supporting English content and other local languages. More countries and languages will then follow. Also new today is the global launch of Creator Studio, where Pages can manage their entire content library and business. This includes the ability to search across their library to view post-level details and insights, as well as manage interactions across Pages, Facebook Messages, comments, and Instagram. Other tools here focus on using Ad Breaks, viewing monetization and payments, and publishing the videos. The Creator Studio is also seeing the addition of a new metric on audience retention added now, allowing publishers to better program their content. YouTube, too, also this year launched an updated version of its Creator Studio, now called YouTube Studio, offering similar analytics for its own network. Facebook isn’t the only one making a play for YouTube’s creators – Amazon’s Twitch hasÂ been offering deals to woo creators to its game-streaming site, a recent report claimed. “Our goal is to provide publishers and creators with the tools they need to build a business on Facebook,” the company said in an announcement. “Facebook’s Fostering an active, engaged community and sharing longer content that viewers seek out and regularly come back to are key to finding success,” it noted.  ",0.002,0.909,0.089,0.9888

The regulator has banned Natural Cycles  from running the advert again, and warned it against exaggerating the efficacy of its product. The ad had stated that âNatural Cycles is a highly accurate, certified, contraceptive app that adapts to every womanâs unique menstrual cycle. Sign up to get to know your body and prevent pregnancies naturallyâ, and in a video below the text it had also stated: âNatural Cycles officially offers a new, clinically tested alternative to birth control methodsâ. The company has leaned heavily on social media marketing to target its âdigital contraceptionâ app at young women. “We told Natural Cycles Nordic AB Sweden not to state or imply that the app was a highly accurate method of contraception and to take care not to exaggerate the efficacy of the app in preventing pregnancies,” said the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) handing down its decision. While Natural Cycles gained EU certification for its app as a contraceptive in February 2017, and most recently FDA clearance for marketing the app as a contraception in the US (with the regulator granting itsÂ De Novo classification request this month), those regulatory clearances come with plenty of caveats about the complexity of the product. The FDA, for example, warns that: “Users must be aware that even with consistent use of the device, there is still a possibility of unintended pregnancy.” At the same time, Natural Cycles has yet to back up the efficacy claims it makes for the product with the scientific âgold standardâ of a randomized control trial. So users wanting to be able to compare the product’s efficacy against other more tried and tested birth control methods (such as the pill or condoms) are not able to do so. No birth control method (barring abstention) is 100% effective of course but, as we’ve reported previously, Natural Cycles’ aggressive marketing and PR has lacked nuance and attempted to downplay concerns about the complexity of its system and the chance of failure even though the product’s performance is impacted by multiple individual factors — from illness, to irregular periods. Which risks being irresponsible. In the ruling, the ASA flags up the relative complexity of Natural Cycles’ system vs more established forms of contraception — pointing out that: The Natural Cycles app required considerably more user input than most forms of contraception, with the need to take and input body temperature measurements several times a week, recording when intercourse had taken place, supplemented with LH measurements, abstention or alternative methods of contraception during the fertile period. The company also remains under investigation in Sweden by the medical regulator after a local hospital reported a number of unwanted pregnancies among users of the app. A spokesperson for the Medical Products Agency told us that it has finalized its investigation and plans to publish the findings next week. Despite all that, Natural Cycles’Â website bills its product as “effective contraception”, claiming the app is “93% effective under typical use” and making the further (and confusingly worded) claim that: “With using the app perfectly, i.e. if you never have unprotected intercourse on red days, Natural Cycles is 99% effective, which means 1 woman out of 100 get pregnant during one year of use.” Perfect use of the app actually means a woman would accurately perform daily measurement of her body temperature without fail or fault, and before she’s even sat up in bed, at least several times a week, correctly inputting the data. Forgetting to do so once because — say — you got up to go to the toilet or were otherwise interrupted before taking or inputting a reading could constitute imperfect use. The BBC spoke to a women who says she made the decision to use the app after seeing that 99% effective claim in Natural Cycles’ marketing on Instagram — and subsequently fell pregnant while using it. “I was sort of sucked into this “99% effective” [claim],” she told the broadcaster. “You know “even more effective than the pill”… What could possibly go wrong?” In its ruling, the regulator said it investigated two issues related to the advert run by Natural Cycles on Facebook on July 20, 2017, and both issues were upheld. The complaints were that Natural Cycles’ advert included misleading and unsubstantiated claims — specifically that the product was: 1. âHighly accurate contraceptive appâ; and 2. âClinically tested alternative to birth control methodsâ. Natural Cycles told the ASA that the latter claim is in fact a quote from a Business Insider article which it “considered to be correct” and had thus reproduced in its marketing. After taking expert evidence, and reviewing three published papers on accumulated data obtained from the app, the regulator deemed the combination of the two claims to be misleading. It writes: We considered that in isolation, the claim âclinically tested alternative to birth control methodsâ was unlikely to mislead. However, when presented alongside the accompanying claim âHighly accurate contraceptive appâ, it further contributed to the impression that the app was a precise and reliable method of preventing pregnancies which could be used in place of other established birth control methods, including those which were highly reliable in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Because the evidence did not demonstrate that in typical-use it was âhighly accurateâ and because it was significantly less effective than the most reliable birth control methods, we considered that in the context of the ad the claim was likely to mislead. The ASA also found the advert to have breached rules for substantiation and exaggeration of marketing messages in the Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products category, as well as being misleading. At the time of writing Natural Cycles had not responded to requests for comment.Â Update:Â A spokeswoman has now emailed us the following statement in response to the ASA ruling: We respect the outcome of the investigation by the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) into one Facebook advertisement, which ran for approximately 4 weeks in mid-2017. The investigation was initiated nearly 12 months ago and the advertisement was removed as soon as we were notified of the complaint. This investigation triggered an internal review of all our advertisements and the way that we communicate more broadly, to ensure our message is clear and provides women with the information they need to determine if Natural Cycles is right for them. As part of these efforts, every advertisement now undergoes a strict approval process by a dedicated taskforce to ensure that it gives an accurate overall impression to the viewer. We actively seek feedback from Natural Cycles users to help us improve the quality of our communications and, moving forwards, we plan to work even more closely with HCPs, women and our user community to test and refine our marketing approach. Natural Cycles has been independently evaluated and cleared by regulators in Europe and the US based on clinical evidence demonstrating its effectiveness as a method of contraception.

Essentially, Twitter deleted its app from Facebook after Facebook  stopped allowing cross-posts earlier this month, since without that feature it was basically useless. This unexpectedly caused old posts to disappear. TechCrunch also heard from a source with understanding of the situation that the deletion of the app took Facebook by surprise, as well as the fact that Twitter didnât immediately tell them to restore the content.) Facebook users are complaining the company has removed the cross-posted tweets they had published to their profiles as Facebook updates. The posts’ removal took place following the recent API change that preventedÂ Twitter users from continuing to automatically publish their tweets to Facebook. According to the affected parties, both the Facebook posts themselves, as well as the conversation around those posts that had taken place directly on Facebook, are now gone. Reached for comment, Facebook says it’s aware of the issue and is looking into it. TechCrunch was alerted to the problem by a reader, Lawrence Miller, who couldn’t find any information about the issue in Facebook’s Help Center. We’ve since confirmed the issue ourselves with several affected parties and confirmed it with Facebook. Given the real-time nature of social media — and how difficult it is to pull up old posts — it’s possible that many of the impacted Facebook users have yet to realize their old posts have been removed. In fact, we only found a handful of public complaints about the deletions, so far. For example: @facebook I used the Twitter for Facebook app for years, and I realize it's not working and isn't going to. But I just discovered all the Facebook updates it put have been deleted and dissappeared from my timeline! Is there a way to retrieve this? — Omer Lev (@omerlev) August 26, 2018  A recent update to the Facebook Platform Policies ended the ability to  automatically post Tweets to our Facebook profile or page and all of our  previous Twitter  posts were deleted by Facebook. #dfwwx #txwx #plano https://t.co/sAOsbdBjVO — Plano, Texas Weather (@PlanoWX) August 24, 2018  My post on Facebook via Twitter was deleted.Why?Can someone explain it? #twitter — Tarin (@lestarindah499) August 26, 2018  Above: selected complaints from Twitter about the data loss  Above: a comment on TechCrunch following our post on the API changesÂ  Some of those who were impacted were very light Facebook users and had heavily relied on the cross-posting to keep their Facebook accounts active. As a result of the mass removals, their Facebook profiles are now fairly empty. TechCrunch editor Matthew Panzarino is one of those here who was impacted. He points out that the ability to share tweets to Facebook was a useful way to reach people who weren’t on Twitter in order to continue a discussion with a different audience. “Iâve had tweet cross-posting turned on for years, from the early days of it even existing. This just removed thousands of posts from my Facebook silently, with no warning,” Matthew told me. “Even though the posts didnât originate on Facebook, I often had ongoing conversations about the posts once my Facebook friends (and audience) saw them. Many of them would never see them on Twitter either because they donât follow me or they donât use it,” he said. “Itâs wild to have all of that context just vanish,” he added. As you may recall, Facebook earlier this month made a change to its API platform to prevent third-party apps from publishing posts to Facebook as the logged-in user. The change was a part of Facebook’s larger overhaul and lockdown of its API platform in the wake of theÂ Cambridge Analytica scandal,Â where as manyÂ as 87 million Facebook usersÂ had their data improperly harvested and shared. Since then, Facebook has been trying to plug up the holes in its platform to prevent further data misuse. One of the changes it made was to stop third-parties from being able to post to Facebook as the logged-in user. For existing apps, like Twitter, that permission was revoked on August 1, 2018.  Above: Twitter’s cross-posting feature, on the day it was disabled by the Facebook API change Before the API changes, Twitter users were able to visit the “Apps” section from Twitter on the web, then authenticate with Facebook to have their tweets cross-posted to Facebook’s social network. Once enabled, the tweets would appear on the user’s page as a Facebook post they had published, and their friends could then like and comment on the post as any other. In theory, the API changes should only have prevented Twitter users from continuing to cross-post their tweets to Facebook automatically. It shouldn’t have also deleted the existing posts from Facebook users’ profiles and business users’ Facebook Pages. This is a breach of trust from a company that’s in the process of trying to repair a broken trust with its users across a number of fronts, including data misuse. Regardless of whatever new policy is in effect around apps and how they can post to Facebook, no one would have ever expected that Facebook would actually remove their old posts without warning. We’re hoping that the problem is a bug that Facebook can resolve, and not something that will result in permanent data loss. Facebook tells us while it doesn’t have further information about the problem at this time, it should have more to share tonight or tomorrow about what’s being done.",0.051,0.882,0.068,0.9191

Turns out we weren’t alone in finding it interesting. The now four-year-old, 40-person outfit, New Knowledge, just sealed up $11 million in new funding led by the cross-border venture firm GGV Capital, with participation from Lux Capital. GGV had also participated in the company’s $1.9 million seed round. We talked yesterday with co-founder and CEO Jonathon Morgan and the company’s director of research, Renee DiResta, to learn more about its work, which appears to be going well. (They say revenue has grown 1,000 percent over last year.) Our conversation, edited for length, follows. TC: A lot of people associate coordinated manipulation by bad actors online with trying to disrupt elections here in the U.S. or withÂ pro-government agendas elsewhere, but you’re working with companies that are also battling online propaganda. Who are some of them? JM: Election interference is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of social media manipulation. Our customers are a little sensitive about being identified, but they are Fortune 100 companies in the entertainment industry, as well as consumer brands. We also have national security customers, though most of our business comes from the private sector. TC: Renee, just a few weeks ago, you testified beforeÂ the Senate Intelligence Committee about how social media platforms have enabled foreign-influence operations against the United States. What was that like? RD: It was a great opportunity to educate the public on what happens and to speak directly to the senators about the need for government to be more proactive and to establish a deterrent strategy because [these disinformation campaigns] aren’t impacting just our elections but our society and American industry. TC: How do companies typically get caught up in these similar practices? JM: It’s pretty typical for consumer-facing brands, because they are so high-profile, to get involved in quasi-political conversations, whether or not they like it. Communities that know how to game the system will come after them over a pro-immigration stance for example. They mobilize and use the same black market social media content providers, the same tools and tactics that are used by Russia and Iran and other bad actors. TC: In other words, this is about ideology, not financial gain. JM: Where we see this more for financial gain is when it involves state intelligence agencies trying to undermine companies where they have nationalized an industry that competes with U.S. institutions like oil and gas and agriculture companies. You can see this is the promotion of anti-GMO narratives, for example. Agricultural tech in the U.S. is a big business, and on the fringes, there’s some debate about whether GMOs are safe to eat, even though the scientific community is clear that they’re completely safe. Meanwhile, there are documented examples of groups aligned with Russian intelligence using purchased social media to circulate conspiracy theories and manipulate the public conversation about GMOs. They find a grain of truth in a scientific article, then misrepresent the findings through quasi-legitimate outlets, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts that are in turn amplified by social media automation. TC: So you’re selling software-as-a-service that does what exactly? JM: We have a SaaS product and a team of analysts who come out of the intelligence community and who help customers understand threats to their brand. It’s an AI-driven system that detects subtle social signs of manipulation across accounts. We then help the companies understand who is targeting them, why, and what they can do about it. TC: Which is what? JM: First, they can’t be blindsided. Many canât tell the difference between real and manufactured public outcry, so they donât even know about it when itâs happening. But there’s a pretty predictable set of tactics that are used to create false public perception. They plant a seed with accounts they control directly that can look quasi-legitimate. Then they amplify it via paid automation, and they target specific individuals who may have an interest in what they have to say. The thinking is that if they can manipulate these microinfluencers, they’ll amplify the message by sharing it with their followers. By then, you can’t put the cat back in the bag.Â  You need to identify [these campaigns] when they’ve lit the match, but haven’t yet started a fire. At the early stage, we canÂ provide information to social media platforms to determine if what’s going on is acceptable within their policies. Longer term, weâre trying to find consensus between governments and also social media platforms themselves over what is and what isn’t acceptable — what’s aggressive conversation on these platforms and what’s out of bounds.  TC: How can you work with them when they can’t even decide on their own policies? JM: First, different platforms are used for different reasons. You see peer-to-peer disinformation, where a small group of accounts drives a malicious narrative on Facebook, which can be problematic at the very local level. Twitter is the platform where media gets its pulse on what’s happening, so attacks launched on Twitter are much more likely to be made into mainstream opinion. There are also a lot of disinformation campaigns on Reddit, but those conversations are less likely to be elevated into a topic on CNN, even while they can shape the opinions of large numbers of avid users. Then there are the off-brand platforms like 4chan, where a lot of these campaigns are born. They are all susceptible in different ways. The platforms have been very receptive. They take these campaigns much more seriously than when they first began looking at election integrity. But platforms are increasingly evolving from more open to more closed spaces, whether it’s WhatsApp groups or private Discord channels or private Facebook channels, and that’s making it harder for the platforms to observe. It’s also making it harder for outsiders who are interested in how these campaigns evolve.",0.059,0.832,0.108,0.9955

So, while the company may have problems keeping foreign nationals from using the platform for influence operations (or garbage influencers from engaging in influence operations), at least they’ll be doing it with less of an effect on climate change. Facebook finds evidence of possible Russia-linked influence campaigns targeting US midterms  Facebook gave itself a well-deserved pat on the back for its pace of acquiring renewable energy. The company bought over 3 gigawatts of new solar and wind energy since its first renewable energy purchase in 2013 (that includes 2.5 gigawatts in the past 12 months alone — a rate of acquisition that makes the intervening years look… well… kind of paltry). What’s especially good about the Facebook renewable purchases is that they’re not just offset agreements — deals where a company buys renewable energy in some far-flung geography to offset the power they’re buying in local markets that relies on traditional carbon-based fuel sources. “All of these wind and solar projects are new and on the same grid as our data centers,” the company said. “That means that each of these projects brings jobs, investment and a healthier environment to the communities that host us — from Prineville, Oregon, and Los Lunas, New Mexico, to Henrico, Virginia, and LuleÃ¥, Sweden.” The targets that Facebook is making public today are part of the company’s commitment to the Paris Agreement through the “We Are Still In” initiative, the company said. For Facebook, the announcement is something of a victory lap. Back in 2015, the company set a goal of having 50 percent of its power supplied to facilities from renewable energy sources by 2018. It actually hit that target in 2017.",0.02,0.9,0.08,0.9484

The program itself involves having local business owners install Wi-Fi hotspots, where internet service is provided by local ISPs, mobile network operators, and others that Facebook has partnered with. Now, Facebook is launching a new partner program that will allow access point manufacturers to build devices compatible with Express Wi-Fi. Its debut lineup of partners for “Express Wi-Fi Certified,” as the partner program is called, include Arista,Â Cambium Networks, andÂ Ruckus Networks, an ARRIS Company. Facebook first began testing Express Wi-Fi three years ago, and has since expanded it to the five above countries and 10 partners. The idea behind the project is to create an entrepreneurial grassroots base for the its Wi-Fi service – that is, the operators and ISPs would be working with local entrepreneurs who want to resell internet access in their own communities. The partners set the prices, but Facebook provides the software. The company has tried to address the needs of developing markets before, via its zero-rating program Free Basics. But this program was criticized over net neutrality concerns, as it only provided access to specific websites – like Facebook, of course – to the developing markets. India eventually banned that program in 2016, as a result. Express Wi-Fi, on the other hand, offers full, unrestricted access to the web, not a selection of pre-approved sites and services. It’s one of Facebook’s many connectivity initiatives today, along with others like OpenCellular, rural access programs, drones, and other infrastructure projects. The new partner program for Express Wi-Fi, announced today, was built to address specific issues Facebook and its partners faced in the field, the company now explains. It says it has been working with the manufacturers to build new access points that better detect registration pages and more accurately count the amount of Wi-Fi data consumed. This will allow the Wi-Fi service providers to sell prepaid access as well as different traffic classes – like offering some services or content for free, while charging for others. Presumably, this would be another avenue of making Facebook free to developing markets down the road. Facebook says having hardware manufacturers on board will help its operator partners more easily set up and manage their Express Wi-Fi hotspots. Weak and expensive connectivity is a big barrier to Facebook adoption in developing markets, especially as user growth in developed regions is stalling – or, even decreasingÂ at times. In July, Facebook reported no user growth in the U.S. and Canada, and a loss of European users it attribute to GDPR requirements. Developing regions, however, are still coming online and could bring Facebook a whole host of new users, if people can get connected.",0.041,0.848,0.112,0.9883

The U.S. company said today that it removed accounts belonging toÂ Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and the military-owned Myawady television network. In total, the purge has swept upÂ 18 Facebook accounts, 52 Facebook Pages and an Instagram  account after the company “found evidence that many of these individuals and organizations committed or enabled serious human rights abuses in the country.” Some 30 million of Myanmar’s 50 million population is estimated to use Facebook, making it a hugely effective broadcast network. But with wide reach comes the potential with misuse, as has been most evident in the U.S. But the Facebook effect is also huge far from the U.S.Â A report from the UN issued in MarchÂ determined that FacebookÂ had played a “determining role” in Myanmarâs crisis.Â The situation in the country is so severe that an estimatedÂ 700,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees are thought to have fled toÂ neighboring Bangladesh following a Myanmar government crackdown that began in August. Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex TillersonÂ labeledÂ the actions as ethnic cleansing. Facebook’s action today comes a week after an investigative report from ReutersÂ found more thanÂ 1,000 posts, comments and images that attacked Rohingya and other Muslim users on the platform. While a new report of finding from the UN also provides more context on how Facebook is used. From the report: The role of social media is significant. Facebook has been a useful instrument forÂ those seeking to spread hate, in a context where for most users Facebook is the Internet.Â Although improved in recent months, Facebookâs response has been slow and ineffective.Â The extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discriminationÂ and violence must be independently and thoroughly examined.

It’s no flop, but the long-form video hub certainly isn’t an instant hit like Instagram  Stories. Two months after that launched in 2016, Instagram was happy to trumpet how its Snapchat clone had hit 100 million users. Yet two months after IGTV’s launch, the Facebook subsidiary has been silent on its traction. “It’s a new format. It’s different. We have to wait for people to adopt it and that takes time,” Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom told me. “Think of it this way: we just invested in a startup called IGTV, but it’s small, and it’s like Instagram was ‘early days.'” It’s indeed too early for a scientific analysis, and Instagram’s feed has been around since 2010, so it’s obviously not a fair comparison, but we took a look at the IGTV view counts of some of the feature’s launch partner creators.Â Across six of those creators, their recent feed videos are getting roughly 6.8X as many views as their IGTV posts. If IGTV’s launch partners that benefited from early access and guidance aren’t doing so hot, it means there’s likely no free view count bonanza in store from other creators or regular users.  They, and IGTV, will have to work for their audience. That’s already proving difficult for the standalone IGTV app. Though it peaked at the #25 overall US iPhone app and has seen 2.5 million downloads across iOS and Android according to Sensor Tower, it’s since dropped to #1497 and seen a 94 percent decrease in weekly installs to just 70,000 last week. Instagram will have to be in it for the long haul if it wants to win at long-form video. Entering the market 13 years after YouTube with a vertical format no one’s quite sure what to do with, IGTV must play the tortoise. If it can avoid getting scrapped or buried, and offer the right incentives and flexibility to creators, IGTV could deliver the spontaneous video viewing experience Instagram lacks. Otherwise, IGTV risks becoming the next Google Plus â a ghost town inside an otherwise thriving product ecosystem.  Instagram gave IGTV a red carpet premiere June 20th in hopes of making it look like the new digital hotspot. The San Francisco launch event offered attendees several types of avocado toast, spa water and ‘Gram-worthy portrait backdrops reminiscent of the Color Factory or Museum of Ice Cream. Instagram hadn’t held a flashy press event since the 2013 launch of video sharing, so it pulled out all the stops. Balloon sculptures lined the entrance to a massive warehouse packed with social media stars and ad execs shouting to each other over the din of the DJ. But things were rocky from the start. Leaks led TechCrunch to report on the IGTV name and details in the preceding weeks. Technical difficulties with Systrom’s presentation pushed back the start, but not the rollout of IGTV’s code. Tipster Jane Manchun Wong sent TechCrunch screenshots of the new app and features a half hour before it was announced, and Instagram’s own Business Blog jumped the gun by posting details of the launch. The web already knew how IGTV would let people upload vertical videos up to an hour long and browse them through categories like “Popular” and “For You” by the time Systrom took the stage. IGTV’s launch event featured Instagram-themed donuts and elaborate portrait backdrops. Images via Vicki’s Donuts and Mai Lanpham “What I’m most proud of is that Instagram took a stand and tried a brand new thing that is frankly hard to pull off. Full-screen vertical video that’s mobile only. That doesn’t exist anywhere else,” Systrom tells me. It was indeed ambitious. Creators were already comfortable making short-form vertical Snapchat Stories by the time Instagram launched its own version. IGTV would have to start from scratch.  Systrom sees the steep learning curve as a differentiator, though. “One of the things I like most about the new format is that it’s actually fairly difficult to just take videos that exist online and simply repost them. That’s not true in feed. That basically forces everyone to create new stuff,” Systrom tells me. “It’s not to say that there isn’t other stuff on there but in general it incentivizes people to produce new things from scratch. And that’s really what we’re looking for. Even if the volume of that stuff at the beginning is smaller than what you might see on the popular page [of Instagram Explore].” Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom unveils IGTV at the glitzy June 20th launch event Instagram forced creators to adopt this proprietary format. But it forget to train Stories stars how to entertain us for five or 15 minutes, not 15 seconds, or convince landscape YouTube moguls to purposefully shoot or crop their clips for the way we normally hold our phones. IGTV’s Popular page features plenty of random viral pap, foreign language content, and poor cropping That should have been the real purpose of the launch party â demonstrating a variety of ways to turn these format constraints or lack thereof into unique content. Vertical video frames people better than places, and the length allows sustained eye-to-lens contacts that can engender an emotional connection. But a shallow array of initial content and too much confidence that creators would figure it out on their own deprived IGTV of emergent norms that other videographers could emulate to wet their feet. Now IGTV feels haphazard, with trashy viral videos and miscropped ports amongst its Popular section alongside a few creators trying to produce made-for-IGTV talk shows and cooking tutorials. It’s yet to have its breakout “Chewbacca Mom” or “Rubberbanded Watermelon” blockbuster like Facebook Live. Even an interview with mega celeb Kylie Jenner only had 11,000 views. Instagram wants to put the focus on the author, not the individual works of art. “Because we don’t have full text search and you can’t just search any random thing, it’s about the creators” Systrom explains. “I think that at its base level that it’s personality driven and creator driven means that you’re going to get really unique content that you won’t find anywhere else and that’s the goal.” Yet being unique requires extra effort that creators might not invest if they’re unsure of the payoff in either reach or revenue. Michael Sayman, formerly Facebook’s youngest employee who was hired at age 17 to build apps for teens and who now works for Google, summed it up saying: “Many times in my own career, Iâve tried to make something with a unique spin or a special twist because I felt thatâs the only way I could make my product stand out from the crowd, only to realize that it was those very twists and spins that made my products feel out of place and confusing to users. Sometimes, the best product is one that doesnât create any new twists, but rather perfects and builds on top of what has been proven to already be extremely successful.” The one big surprise of the launch event was where IGTV would exist. Instagram announced it’d live in a standalone IGTV app, but also as a feature in the main app accessible from an orange button atop the home screen that would occasionally call out that new content was inside. It could have had its own carousel like Stories or been integrated into Explore until it was ready for primetime. Instead, it was ignorable. IGTV didn’t get the benefit of the home screen spotlight like Instagram Stories. Blow past that one orange button and avoid downloading the separate app, and users could go right on tapping and scrolling through Instagram without coming across IGTV’s longer videos. View counts of the launch partners reflect that. We looked at six launch partner creators, comparing their last six feed and IGTV videos older than a week and less than six months old, or fewer videos if that’s all they’d posted.  Only one of the six, BabyAriel, saw an obvious growth trend in her IGTV videos. Her candid IGTV monologues are performing the best of the six compared to feed. She’s earning an average of 243,000 views per IGTV video, about a third as many as she gets on her feed videos. “I’m really happy with my view counts because IGTV is just starting”Â BabyAriel tells me. She thinks the format will be good for behind-the-scenes clips that complement her longer YouTube videos and shorter Stories. “When I record anything, It’s vertical. When I turn my phone horizontal I think of an hour-long movie.”  Lele Pons, a Latin American comedy and music star who’s one of the most popular Instagram celebrities, gets about 5.7X more feed views than on her IGTV cooking show that averages 1.9 million hits. Instagram posted some IGTV highlights from the first month, but the most popular of now hasÂ 4.3 million views — less than half of what Pons gets on her average feed video. Fitness guides from Katie Austin averaged just 3,600 views on IGTV while she gets 7.5X more in the feed. Lauren Godwin’s colorful comedy fared 5.2X better in the feed. Bryce Xavier saw the biggest differential, earning 15.9X more views for his dance and culture videos. And in the most direct comparison, K-Pop dancer Susie Shu sometimes posts cuts from the same performance to the two destinations, like one that got 273,000 views in feed but just 27,000 on IGTV, with similar clips fairing an average of 7.8X better.  Again, this isn’t to say IGTV is a lame horse. It just isn’t roaring out of the gates. Systrom remains optimistic about inventing a new format. “The question is can we pull that off and the early signs are really good,” he tells me. “We’ve been pretty blown away by the reception and the usage upfront,” though he declined to share any specific statistics. Instagram promised to provide more insight into traction in the future. YouTube star Casey Neistat is less bullish. He doesn’t think IGTV is working and that engagement has been weak. If IGTV views were surpassing those of YouTube, creators would flock to it, but so far view counts are uninspiring and not worth diverting creative attention, Neistat says. “YouTube offers the best sit-back consumption, and Stories offers active consumption. Where does IGTV fit in? I’m not sure” he tells me. “Why create all of this unique content if it gets lower views, it’s not monetizable, and the viewers aren’t there?” Susie Shu averages 7.8X more video views in the Instagram feed than on IGTV For now, the combination of an unfamiliar format, the absence of direction for how to use it and the relatively buried placement has likely tempered IGTV’s traction. Two months in, Instagram Stories was proving itself an existential threat to Snapchat â which it’s in fact become. IGTV doesn’t pose the same danger to YouTube yet, and it will need a strategy to support a more slow-burn trajectory. The first step to becoming a real YouTube challenger is to build up some tent-pole content that gives people a reason to open IGTV. Until there’s something that captures attention, any cross-promotion traffic Instagram sends it will be like pouring water into a bucket with a giant hole in the bottom. Yet until there’s enough viewers, it’s tough to persuade creators to shoot for IGTV since it won’t do a ton to boost their fan base.  Fortnite champion Ninja shares a photo of IGTV launch partners gathered backstage at the press event Meanwhile, Instagram hasn’t committed to a monetization or revenue-sharing strategy for IGTV. Systrom said at the launch that “Thereâs no ads in IGTV today,â but noted it’s âobviously a very reasonable place [for ads] to end up.â Without enough views, though, ads won’t earn enough for a revenue split to incentivize creators. Perhaps Instagram will heavily integrate its in-app shopping features and sponsored content partnerships, but even those rely on having more traffic. Vine withered at Twitter in part from creators bailing due to its omission of native monetization options. So how does IGTV solve the chicken-and-egg problem? It may need to swallow its pride and pay early adopters directly for content until it racks up enough views to offer sustainable revenue sharing. Instagram has never publicly copped to paying for content before, unlike its parent Facebook, which offered stipends ranging into the millions of dollars for publishers to shoot Live broadcasts and long-form Watch shows. Neither have led to a booming viewership, but perhaps that’s because Facebook has lost its edge with the teens who love video.  Instagram could do better if it paid the right creators to weather IGTV’s initial slim pickings. Settling on ad strategy creators can count on earning money from in the future might also get them to hang tight. Those deals could mimic the 55 percent split of mid-roll ad breaks Facebook gives creators on some videos. But again, the views must come first. Alternatively, or additionally, it could double down on the launch strategy of luring creators with the potential to become the big fish in IGTV’s small-for-now pond. Backroom deals to trade being highlighted in its IGTV algorithm in exchange for high-quality content could win the hearts of these stars and their managers. Instagram would be wise to pair these incentives with vertical long-form video content creation workshops. It could bring its community, product and analytics leaders together with partnered stars to suss out what works best in the format and help them shoot it. Once there’s something worth watching on IGTV, the company could open the cross-promo traffic spigot. At first, Instagram would send notifications about top content or IGTV posts from people you follow, and call them out with a little orange text banner atop its main app. Now it seems to understand it will need to be more coercive.  Last month, TechCrunch tipster Jane Manchun Wong spotted Instagram showing promos for individual IGTV shows in the middle of the feed, hoping to redirect eyeballs there. And today, TechCrunch researcher Matt Navarra found Instagram getting more aggressive by putting a bigger call out featuring a relevant IGTV clip with preview image above your Stories tray on the home screen. It may need to boost the frequency of these cross-promotions and stick them in-between Stories and Explore sections as well to give IGTV the limelight. These could expose users to creators they don’t follow already but might enjoy. “Itâs still early but I do think thereâs a lot of potential when they figure out two things since the feature is so new,” says John Shahidi, who runs the Justin Bieber-backed Shots Studios, which produces and distributes content for Lele Pons, Rudy Mancuso and other Insta celebs. “1. Product. IGTV is not in your face so Instagram users arenât changing behavior to consume. Timeline and Instagram Stories are in your face so those two are the most used features. 2. Discoverability. I want to see videos from people I donât follow. Interesting stuff like cooking, product review, interesting content from brands but without following the accounts.” In the meantime, Shots Studios is launching a vertical-only channel on YouTube that Shahidi believes is the first of its kind.  Instagram will have to balance its strategic imperative to grow the long-form video hub and avoid spamming users until they hate the brand as a whole. Some think it’s already gone too far. “I think it’s super intrusive right now,” says Tiffany Zhong, once known as the world’s youngest venture capitalist who now runs Generation Z consulting firm Zebra Intelligence. “I personally find all the IGTV videos super boring and click out within seconds (and the only time I watch them are if I accidentally tapped on the icon when I tried to go to my DMs instead).” Desperately funneling traffic to the feature before there’s enough great content to power relevant recommendations for everyone could prematurely sour users on IGTV.Â  Systrom remains optimistic he can iterate his way to success. “What I want to see over the next six to 12 months is a consistent drumbeat of new features that both consumers and creators are asking for, and to look at the retention curve and say ‘are people continuing to watch? Are people continuing to upload?,'” says Systrom. “So far we are seeing that all of those are healthy. But again trying to judge a very new kind of audacious format that’s never really been done before in the first months is going to be really hard.”  The biggest question remains whether IGTV will remain devout to the orthodoxy of vertical-only. Loosening up to accept landscape videos too might nullify a differentiator, but also pipe in a flood of content it could then algorithmically curate to bootstrap IGTV’s library. Reducing the friction by allowing people to easily port content to or from elsewhere might make it feel like less of a gamble for creators deciding where to put their production resources. Instagram itself expanded from square-only to portrait and landscape photos in the feed in 2015. “My advice would be to make the videos horizontal. Weâve all come to understand vertical as ‘short form’ and horizontal as ‘long form,'” says Sayman. “Itâs in the act of rotating your phone to landscape that you indicate to yourself and to your mobile device that you will not be context switching for the next few minutes, but rather intend to focus on one piece of content for an extended period of time.” This would at least give users more to watch, even if they ended up viewing landscape videos with their phones in portrait orientation. This might be best as a last-ditch effort if it can’t get enough content flowing in through other means. But at least Instagram should offer a cropping tool that lets users manually select what vertical slice of a landscape video they want to show as they watch, rather than just grabbing the center or picking one area on the side for the whole clip. This could let creators repurpose landscape videos without things getting awkwardly half cut out of frame. Former Facebook employee and social investor Josh Elman, who now works at Robinhood, told me he’s confident the company will experiment as much as necessary. “I think Facebook is relentless. They know that a ton of consumers watch video online. And most discover videos through influencers or their friends. (Or Netflix). Even though Watch and IGTV havenât taken the world by storm yet, I bet Facebook wonât stop until they find the right mix.â There’s a goldmine waiting if it does.Â Unlike on Facebook, thereâs no Regram feature, you canât post links, and outside of Explore you just see who you already follow on Instagram. Thatâs made it great at delivering friendly video and clips from your favorite stars, but leaves a gaping hole where serendipitous viewing could be. IGTV fills that gap. The hours people spend on Facebook watching random videos and their accompanying commercials have lifted the company to over $13 billion in revenue per quarter. Giving a younger audience a bottomless pit of full-screen video could produce the same behavior and profits on Instagram without polluting the feed, which can remain the purest manifestation of visual feed culture. But that’s onlyÂ if IGTV can get enough content uploaded.  Puffed up by the success of besting its foe Snapchat, Instagram assumed it could take the long-form video world by storm. But the grand entrance at its debutante ball didn’t draw enough attention. Now it needs to take a different tack. Tone down the cross-promo for the moment. Concentrate on teaching creators how to find what works on the format and incentivizing them with cash and traffic. Develop some must-see IGTV and stoke a viral blockbuster. ProveÂ the gravity of extended, personality-driven vertical video. Only then should it redirect traffic there from the feed, Stories, and Explore.  YouTube’s library wasn’t built overnight, and neither will IGTVâs.Â Facebook’s deep pockets and the success of Instagram’s other features give it the runway necessary to let IGTV take off. With 1 billion monthly users, and 400 million daily Stories users gathered in just two years, there are plenty of eyeballs waiting to be seduced. Systrom concludes, “Everything that is great starts small.”Â IGTV’s destiny will depend on Instagram’s patience.",0.046,0.834,0.12,0.9998

Yesterday, BuzzFeed reported that a dozen tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Snapchat, would meet at Twitter headquarters on Friday to discuss election security. For two of them, that wasn’t the only meeting in the books. In what appears to be a separate event on Friday, Facebook  and Microsoft also met with the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and two bodies of state election officials, the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) and the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), about their election security efforts. The discussion was the second of its kind connecting DHS, Facebook and state election officials on “actions being taken to combat malicious interference operations.” The meetings offer two very different perspectives on threats to election security. States are largely concerned with securing voter databases and election systems, while private tech companies are waging a very public war against coordinated disinformation campaigns by U.S. foreign adversaries on their platforms. Social media platforms and election systems themselves are two important yet usually disconnected fronts in the ongoing war against Russian election interference.  “Effectively combatting coordinated information operations requires many parts of society working together, which is why Facebook believes so strongly in the need for collaboration between law enforcement, government agencies, security experts and other companies to confront these growing threats,” Facebook VP of Public Policy Kevin Martin said of the meeting. “We are grateful for the opportunity to brief state election officials on a recent call convened by DHS and again today as part of our continued effort to develop collaborative relationships between government and private industry.” Curiously, while Microsoft  and Facebook attended the DHS-hosted meeting, it doesn’t look like Twitter did. To date, Twitter and Facebook have faced the most fallout for foreign interference on their platforms meant to influence American politics, though Google was also called to Congress to testify on the issue last fall. When reached, Twitter declined to comment on its absence, though the company was reportedly playing host to the other major tech election security meeting today. The meeting with state officials sounds like it was largely informative in nature, with Facebook and Microsoft providing insight on their respective efforts to contain foreign threats to election integrity. On Tuesday, Microsoft revealed that its Digital Crimes Unit secured a court order to take down six domains created by Russia’s GRU designed to phish user credentials. Half of the phishing domains were fake versions of U.S. Senate websites. “No one organization, department or individual can solve this issue alone, thatâs why information sharing is so important,”Â said Microsoft VP of Customer Security and TrustÂ Tom Burt. “To really be successful in defending democracy, technology companies, government, civil society, the academic community and researchers need to come together and partner in new and meaningful ways.”",0.048,0.829,0.123,0.9844

Antonio Lucio today announced he’ll be leaving his role as HP’s CMO after three years to take that post at Facebook starting September 4th. Heâs replacing Gary Briggs, who in January said he’d be stepping down after five years to advise companies and work with the Democrats. Lucio’s hispanic background and his efforts to champion inclusion will bring needed diversity to Facebook’s management, whose CEO, COO, CFO, CTO and CFO are all white. Lucio will report to Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and be part of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg’s leadership team.Â  Facebook confirms he’ll work across the company’s family of apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, which both lack a named CMO. Prior to HP, Lucio was Visa’s chief marketing and communications officer for seven years, and had been at PepsiCo leading innovation and beverage marketing for eight years before that. “Facebook’s story is at an inflection point. We have never faced bigger challenges, and we have never had more opportunities to have a positive impact on the world â in our families, our friendships, our communities, and our democracy â by improving our products at their core, and then by telling the story outside that we all know to be true inside,” Cox wrote on Facebook. “[Lucio] has been outspoken on the need to build authentic global brands with integrity and from places of principle, and also on the importance of building diverse teams at every level in the organization.” Lucio is well-versed in the flowery philosophical rhetoric common at Facebook. He describes himself on LinkedIn as someone “who’s mission in life is to build brands that stand the test of time. These brands are anchored in purpose; have a meaningful impact on people’s lives; are built through strong emotional connections; behave with integrity and are constantly reinventing themselves to deliver their purpose.” .@HP's global CMO @ajlucio5 discusses a new report from the company that shows how the efforts to close the diversity gap in their workforce have unquestionably led to positive business results. #CannesLions #CheddarLIVE pic.twitter.com/NYqS0BMHOE — Cheddar (@cheddar) June 21, 2018  Lucio’s public persona sees him frequently retweeting accolades for his female peers. He’s been named the No. 2 most influential CMO by Forbes, and has received awards from PR Week and Women In Marketing for pushing diversity. At HP, he helped launched the #MoreLikeMe campaign to increase the number of women in leadership roles, growing their percentage amongst top HP marketing jobs from 20 percent to 50 percent. He credits this with contributing to a 6 percent year-over-year boost in HP’s brand preference scores. You can see him talk more about the initiative on Cheddar above. Sandberg writes that “Antonio has a lot of experience leading marketing for major brands like HP and Visa — and heâs been recognized for both his talents and commitment to diversity.” She’ll benefit from the help repairing Facebook’s brand after a string of troubles ranging from Cambridge Analytica to election interference, slowing user growth to worries that too much Facebooking can hurt our well-being. A job listing for the CMO role mentioned candidates would need to be able to “guide a brand’s reputation and experience in crisis management.”  Facebook has recently undertaken a massive apology ad campaign on TV, bus stops and elsewhere, touting that it understands its responsibility to keep elections and users’ data safe. But Lucio will need to translate all of Facebook’s nitty-gritty behind-the-scenes work on these issues into comprehensible messaging that keeps users from straying from the social network. Meanwhile, he’ll also be in charge of Facebook product marketing. With so many features packed into the app and fighting for attention, Lucio will have to decide what to highlight and how. The question is whether he’ll think more holistically, supporting the natural cannibalization of Facebook by its fresher-faced acquisitions, or put big blue first. âPurpose and impact have been at the center of every career decision that I have ever made,” Lucio told TechCrunch in a statement. âFacebook is one of the worldâs most impactful brands, at a pivotal moment in its history. I am honored to join the team and support its evolution.â Indeed, it’s time for Facebook to evolve, but Lucio will have to prove he can be the wartime leader it needs.",0.029,0.883,0.088,0.9822

According to the document, the company plans to raise $200 million from selling Class A shares, but has yet to list the price per share. As for what Eventbrite intends to do with the new funds, many are pointing to the need to recover the company’s recent losses. While the company reported a net profit of $201.6 million in 2017, operating and loss expenses still left the company unprofitable that year. The company reported a net loss of $38.5 million in 2017 and a loss so far in 2018 of $15.6 million. However, the company does report a net revenue growth of 51 percent and reported a net revenue of $142 million so far in 2018. The filing lists Goldman Sachs as a lead underwriter and bolsters the company’s commitment to providing a platform to “creators of all types” as a competitive advantage. To continue this commitment, the company says it intends to add extended capabilities across categories and countries. While the company has been in the event space for a while, even older companies like Ticketmaster, StubHub and Live Nation continue to give the company a run for its money — and its customers. For perspective, in 2017,Â Live Nation reported a record $10.4 billion in revenue. Social platforms like Facebook have also recently complicated this space by integrating ticket purchasing portalsÂ onto its site to direct customers to both Ticketmaster or Eventbrite. While driving one-time purchases to the services, these on-site portals keep users sequestered on Facebook and in turn don’t allow them to browse other options offered by the ticketing sites.

Consider a plan to create an alternative funded by public money. That was the suggestion today put forward by Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party in the UK, who proposed the creation of a “British Digital Corporation” (BDC) that would be a sister organization to the BBC (the publicly-funded British Broadcasting Corporation), and would work as both a think-tank to lead on digital policy and technology, as well as become the home of non-profit services to rival those that are for-profit, including a Facebook alternative. “A BDC could use all of our best minds, the latest technology and our existing public assets not only deliver information and entertainment to rival Netflix and Amazon, but also to harness data for the public good,” Corbyn said today, in a speech delivered during the Edinburgh TV festival.Â “A BDC could develop new technology for online decision making and audience-led commissioning of programmes and even a public social media platform with real privacy and public control over the data that is making Facebook and others so rich.” The full text of his lecture can be found here. The BBC today is largely financed by something called a “TV license”, where people living in the UK pay annual fees for the “right” to receive terrestrial channels. Corbyn suggested that the BDC would be run in a similar way: the government should introduce a digital license fee, he said, to supplement the TV license fee. This would be paid either by way of ISPs (who might pass the cost on to their customers), or by “tech giants”, or perhaps a combination of the two. Poorer households would pay a reduced fee. Corbyn’s comments and ideas come at a time when the we are still getting to the bottom of just what role widely-used social media platforms like Facebook played — if not actively, then passively, as a highly influential social media platforms manipulated by others — to influence the outcome of key democratic processes, such as the Brexit referendum in the UK and the most recent US Presidential election. In that vein, he also suggested a wave of proposals to increase transparency in media communications. They included a Freedom of Information reform that removed ministerial vetoes and expanded it to include cases where private companies are delivering public services; allowing local, investigative and public interest journalism to be taxed as charities; asking “tech giants” to contribute to an independent fund for public interest journalism; and expanding an existing BBC scheme to foster more local journalism (which has really died a death in the UK, as it has in many other places). Digital delivery would, of course, have a big role to play in this. The issue of there being too few for-profit tech companies that control tech services has a precedent in the media industry, something that Corbyn also directly attacked. “We must also break the stranglehold of elite power and billionaire domination over large parts of our media,” he said. “Just three companies control 71% of national newspaper circulation and five companies control 81% of local newspaper circulation.” Corbyn, coming in the wake of moderate leaders like Tony Blair and others in his mold, is one of the more left-wing Labour Party leaders in recent times who has advocated for a much wider set of social services and a move away from for-profit organizations and their encroaching role in how these are delivered. In that context, any comments about publicly funded social media services shouldn’t come as a surprise. And even if he is not the Prime Minister, Corbyn’s comments should not be taken lightly. In his role as leader of the opposition, his speech sets an agenda and debating points around how publicly-funded digital services might take shape in years to come. That is something that the Tories (whose leader, Theresa May, is the Prime Minister) have also been contemplating. Up to now the focus has been in areas like developing AI, 5G and cybersecurity, although with a heavy emphasis on helping fund and boost private-sector businesses. There are a number of issues that Corbyn’s comments raise, not just about the free market, but about what a publicly-funded model might imply for startups — which are (in theory!) for profit and part of a large push to boost entrepreneurship and small businesses. Similarly, in cities like London, the same oversized tech companies that Corbyn might be criticising have had a big part to play in boosting the local economy, and threats of much higher taxes could have a chilling effect on their activities here. Ultimately, all that will need to be considered when and if we see these ideas mature from their early introduction in a summertime speech.",0.043,0.842,0.115,0.9955

So far this is only the second app to be banned as a result of the company’s large-scale audit begun in March; but as myPersonality hasn’t been active since 2012, and was to all appearances a legitimate academic operation, it’s a bit of a mystery why they bothered. The total number of app suspensions has reached 400, twice the number we last heard Facebook announce publicly. Suspensions aren’t listed publicly, however, and apps may be suspended and reinstated without any user notification. The only other app to be banned via this process is Cambridge Analytica. myPersonality was created by researchers at the Cambridge Psychometrics Centre (no relation to Cambridge Analytica â this is an actual academic institution) to source data from Facebook users via personality quizzes. It operated from 2007 to 2012, and was quite successful, gathering data on some four million users (directly, not via friends) when it was operational. The data set was used for the Centre’s own studies and other academics could request access to it via an online form; applications were vetted by CPC staff and had to be approved by the petitioner’s university’s ethics committee. It transpired in May that a more or less complete set of the project’s data was available for anyone to download from GitHub, put there by some misguided scholar who had received access and decided to post it where their students could access it more easily. Anyone could download Cambridge researchers’ 4-million-user Facebook data set for years  Facebook suspended the app around then, saying “we believe that it may have violated Facebook’s policies.” That suspension has graduated into a ban, because the creators “fail[ed] to agree to our request to audit and because it’s clear that they shared information with researchers as well as companies with only limited protections in place.” This is, of course, a pot-meet-kettle situation, as well as something of a self-indictment. I contacted David Stillwell, one of the app’s creators and currently deputy director of the CPC, having previously heard from him and collaborator Michel Kosinski about the data set and Facebook’s sudden animosity. “Facebook has long been aware of the applicationâs use of data for research,” Stillwell said in a statement. “In 2009 Facebook certified the app as compliant with their terms by making it one of their first ‘verified applications.’ In 2011 Facebook invited me to a meeting in Silicon Valley (and paid my travel expenses) for a workshop organised by Facebook precisely because it wanted more academics to use its data, and in 2015 Facebook invited Dr Kosinski to present our research at their headquarters.” During that time, Kosinski and Stillwell both told me, dozens of universities had published in total more than a hundred social science research papers using the data. No one at Facebook or elsewhere seems to have raised any issues with how the data was stored or distributed during all that time. “It is therefore odd that Facebook should suddenly now profess itself to have been unaware of the myPersonality research and to believe that the data may have been misused,” Stillwell said. Examples of data sets available via the myPersonality project A Facebook representative told me they were concerned that the vetting process for getting access to the data set was too loose, and furthermore that the data was not adequately anonymized. But Facebook would, ostensibly, have approved these processes during the repeated verifications of myPersonality’s data. Why would it suddenly decide in 2018, when the app had been inactive for years, that it had been in violation all that time? The most obvious answer would be that its auditors never looked very closely in the first place, despite a cozy relationship with the researchers. “When the app was suspended three months ago I asked Facebook to explain which of their terms was broken but so far they have been unable to cite any instances,” said Stillwell. Ironically, Facebook’s accusation that myPersonality failed to secure user data correctly is exactly what the company itself appears to be guilty of, and at a far greater scale. Just as CPC could not control what a researcher did with the data (for example, mistakenly post it publicly) once they had been approved by multiple other academics, Facebook could not control what companies like Cambridge Analytica did with data once it had been siphoned out under the respectable guise of research purposes. (Notably, it is projects like myPersonality that seem to have made that guise respectable to begin with.) Perhaps Facebook’s standards have changed and what was okay by them in 2012 â and, apparently, in 2015 â is not acceptable now. Good â users want stronger protections. But this banning of an app inactive for years and used successfully by real academics for actual research purposes has an air of theatricality. It helps no one and will change nothing about myPersonality itself, which Stillwell and others stopped maintaining years ago, or the data set it created, which may very well still be analyzed for new insights by some enterprising social science grad student. Facebook has mobilized a full-time barn door-closing operation years after the horses bolted, as evident by today’s ban. So when you and the other four million people get a notification that Facebook is protecting your privacy by banning an app you used a decade ago, take it with a grain of salt.",0.087,0.823,0.09,0.0969

The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple has deemed Facebook-owned app Onavo in violation of its App Store policies and will be giving it the boot shortly. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Apple  spokesperson explained the reasoning behind its decision to pull the app: We work hard to protect user privacy and data security throughout the Apple ecosystem. With the latest update to our guidelines, we made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a userâs device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing and must make it clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used. In some ways, it’s a wonder that Onavo  has lasted this long. Onavo, which Facebook bought back in 2013, does two things. As far as regular consumers are concerned, Onavo comports itself like a VPN, offering to “keep you and your data safe” and “blocking potentially harmful websites and securing your personal information.”  But Onavo’s real utility is pumping a ton of app usage data to its parent company, giving Facebook an invaluable bird’s-eye view into mobile trends by observing which apps are gaining traction and which are fizzling out. That perspective is useful both from a product standpoint, allowing Facebook to get ahead of the competition (Snapchat is a fine example), and giving it an edge for considering which competitors to acquire. That dual personality is likely part of the problem for Apple. In its descriptions, Onavo leans heavily on its promise to “protect your personal information” and the cover story of a fairly legitimate looking VPN. With no meaningful opt-in for users who want to use Onavo’s VPN services but might be hesitant about sharing data with Facebook, the app’s true intentions were buried deep in its description: “Onavo collects your mobile data traffic… Because we’re part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.” By February of this year, the Onavo app had been downloaded more than 33 million times across both iOS and Android. While the app is no longer showing up in searches within Apple’s App Store, it’s still alive and well in Google’s considerably more free-wheeling app store, so Facebook will have to lean more heavily on its Android eyes and ears for now.",0.027,0.853,0.121,0.9886

During his long tenure at the company, Rose oversaw Facebook’s transformation into a media giant, steering it toward partnerships with TV networks and traditional news publishers. In a comment on his announcement, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg summarized Rose’s influence on Facebook’s direction over the years. “Your idea that we should be a partnership company and work closely with others in the industry has been key to some of our greatest successes,” Sandberg said. “Iâve been lucky to have you not just as a colleague but a friend â and you will always be a part of the Facebook family.”  Per his Facebook post, Rose will step down from his post to spend more time with his wife and children, who relocated to Hawaii a year ago. “Mark and Sheryl changed my life and my career.

As an early investor in Xiaomi in spring 2010 and a former board member of the company, I attended Xiaomi’s IPO in Hong Kong on July 9. I felt nostalgic and grateful, and marveled at how much Xiaomi — which seemed like a crazy idea to many back in January 2010 — has achieved over the past eight years. Xiaomi’s business model is not the easiest to appreciate if you have never tried its products. Its holistic value proposition doesnât have an easy equivalent in the US.Â I frequently get asked questions about how the company works and what justifies its valuation for each round over the years. Hereâs my take on the five most asked questions: At first glance Xiaomi may seem like a hardware company, which traditionally has lower gross margins. But if you look at the company as a whole and how it engages with users, itâs much more â itâs an Internet company. It is true that around 70% of Xiaomiâs revenue comes from smartphones, 20% comes from connected devices and lifestyle products, and 10% comes from Internet services in 2017.Â Yet, you can actually think of smartphones as Xiaomi’s customer acquisition tool for its Internet services. Once users get a taste of Xiaomi through its smartphones, they fall in love with the brandâs superb design, ease of usage, quality, and amazing price-to-performance ratio, and are more likely to buy a Xiaomi smart TV next, then Xiaomi’s smart home appliances, and finally use Xiaomiâs apps. Over time, Xiaomi’s Internet service revenue will grow more rapidly than most people think. As of March 2018, Xiaomi already had 38 apps with more than 10 million monthly active users, and 18 apps with more than 50 million monthly active users, including the Mi App Store, Mi Browser, Mi Music, and Mi Video apps.Â Rather than paying search engines to acquire users, Xiaomi is essentially getting paid for acquiring users through selling its smartphones. This allows Xiaomi to have a negative CAC (customer acquisition cost) for its Internet services. Another under-appreciated pillar of Xiaomi’s growth is its “ecosystem strategy.” Xiaomi strategically invests in many startups as well as the many Internet services providers they work with, both in China and outside of China.Â Companies in the Xiaomi ecosystem include SmartMi (air purifiers), Zimi (power banks), Huami (Mi bands), Chun Mi (rice cookers), and 80-plus more. Thanks to these prolific investments, you can find a wide variety of products in any Xiaomi store, from scooters to ukeleles (see below). As a result, every time consumers visit a Xiaomi store, they can find something new, and the frequency of store visits is a lot higher than typical smartphone brands, even Apple.Â   Xiaomi’s users are often loyal to the brand because there are so many great Xiaomi ecosystem products consumers can buy. Over 1.4 million users already own more than five connected Xiaomi products (excluding smartphones and laptops).Â The rising middle class in China and other emerging markets trust, embrace, and identify with the Xiaomi brand â similar to how Muji and Uniqlo from Japan are loved by consumers worldwide. Overtime, as more users become “Mi fans”, Xiaomi’s Internet service revenue will grow, but there is a lagging effect, which many public investors donât fully appreciate yet. In addition, Xiaomi also invests in Internet service providers. It then preloads their content into its own apps, or preloads their apps into its own phones and smart TVs. For example, within the MiÂ Video app, you can access content from top Chinese video platforms likeÂ iQiyi and Youku Tudou, because Xiaomi was an investor in these companies.Â Xiaomi shares advertising and subscription revenue with these platforms, allowing it to rapidly grow its revenue from Internet services, which have extremely high margins.  I have known CEO and founder LEI Jun for almost 10 years. We first met when he became an angel investor in early 2008. When Lei Jun first told me about his idea for Xiaomi in January 2010 in Beijing,Â I listened to his pitch (there wasn’t even a PowerPoint) and it took about 90 minutes before I decided to invest. He used five arguments to convince me. The team he assembled was the only one that had experience in four out of the five areas that I considered to be critical to the success for his âtriathlon modelâ: No one else had all these skills under one roof. This is why I thought Xiaomi might have the chance to do something very special. However, for anyone who passed on Xiaomi early, it was very a reasonable and logical decision.Â In the history of mobile phone companies around the world, no startup had ever been successful. Some even predicted that for Xiaomi to succeed, Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia would all have to fail. In 2010, that seemed a crazy idea. But the rest is history.Â   Xiaomi did a great job in recruiting Hugo Barra, who was formerly an executive at Google Android, to join themÂ as Head of International in 2013. Hugoâs experience lent credibility to Xiaomi, as he became the international face of the company for the next three to four years. He also recruited several young executives and country managers, mostly in their late 20s or early 30s back then, many of whom were first-generation Chinese Americans or Western educated immigrants. These executives have helped Xiaomi become a global company, and they all have a bright future ahead of them with more responsibilities to come. It’s really important to hire the right head of international and country managers to make it work. Conversely, when US companies go to China, it’s harder to hire young millennials to spearhead the China business because the Chinese Internet space is a lot more difficult to navigate. But as there are more and more Gen Z and millennial consumers in China, American and international companies can take more chances, recruit young entrepreneurs to join them, and form an advisory board of industry veterans and investors around their China initiative. In my opinion, the US market is not an immediate priority for Xiaomi today. Emerging markets, which include India, Southeast Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Latin America, represent much bigger and immediate opportunities. Xiaomi is already in 74 countries today. In the first quarter of 2018, over 36% of Xiaomi’s revenue came from markets outside of China.Â According to IDC, in Q4 2017, Xiaomi was among the top five smartphone brands in terms of unit shipments in 15 countries, including India (No. 1), Indonesia (No. 2), Russia, Poland, Greece, and Israel.Â Xiaomi also has plans to double down on markets in Latin America such as Mexico. Why is this significant? Allow me to share a historical lesson. When Yahoo! Invested in Alibaba (another GGV portfolio company) in 2005, the world had 1 billion Internet users. Now, the world has 3.5 billion Internet users. Over the last 13 years, Alibaba’s valuation increased 100 times from $5 billion to $500 billion. The fact that China was the fastest growing market for Internet users during this period, coupled with Alibaba’s amazing ability to execute, turned the company into a growth miracle.Â In the next 12-13 years, the world will most likely grow to 5 billion Internet users. The world’s next 1 billion Internet users that will come online in the next decade – via affordable but high-quality smartphones – are outside of the US. They are in the 74 countries that Xiaomi is already in today.Â Going forward, Xiaomi is very well-positioned to take advantage of the next phase of growth through selling hardware, software, and bundled Internet services, as well as by investing in partner companies in those countries.  I think Xiaomi is undervalued at HK$17 per share. Xiaomiâs was the worldâs largest tech IPO since Alibabaâs in 2014 and it has a relatively complicated business model, so it might take time for public investors to understand and appreciate. I believe Xiaomi will deliver performance that beats expectations going forward. If you look at the IPO price of HK$17 a share, Xiaomi was valued using a revenue multiple of 10x for its Internet services (a discount to Alibaba and Tencent), and 2x for its hardware-related revenue (an average multiple for one of Chinaâs favorite brands), based on the 2017 numbers. So there is still a lot of potential for upside both in terms of operational growth and multiple expansions. I remember when Facebook went public in 2012, its share was priced at $38 and its first day of trading ended at $38.23. Obviously, six years later, Facebook is now worth about five times its valuation at IPO. Similarly, there’s a lot of room for Xiaomi to grow.Â  Iâd like to give a shoutout to other major early investors in Xiaomi, including Richard Liu of Morningside Venture Capital, Tuck Koh of ShunWei Capital, and Yuri Milner, Shou Zi Chew (now Xiaomiâs CFO) of DST Global. Their continued support has been instrumental to Xiaomiâs success.

Chief executive Alexis Rovner, herself a post-doctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute, and chief operating officer Ryan Gallagher, a former BCG Consultant, are looking to commercialize research from the Institute aroundÂ accelerating and expanding the ability to produce functionalized proteins and sequence-defined polymers with diverse chemistries. Basically they’ve engineered a new life form that they want to use for novel kinds of bio-manufacturing. Why we liked it:Â These geniuses invented a new life form.  Sher Butt, a former lab directory at Steep Hill, saw that cannabinoids were as close to a miracle cure for pain, epilepsy and other chronic conditions as medicine was going to get. But plant-based cannabinoids were costly and produced inconsistent results. Alongside Jacob Vogan, Butt realized that biosynthesizing cannabinoids would reduce production costs by a factor of 10 and boost production 24 times current yields. With a deep experience commercializing drugs for Novartis  and as the founder of the cannabis testing company SB Labs, Butt and his technical co-founder are uniquely positioned to bring this new therapy to market. Why we liked it:Â Using manufacturing processes to make industrial quantities of what looks like nature’s best painkiller at scale is not a bad idea.  RevenueCatÂ helps developers manage their in-app subscriptions. It offers an API that developers can use to support in-app subscriptions on iOS and Android, which means they donât have to worry about all the nuances, bugs and updates on each platform. The API also allows developers to bring all the data about their subscription business together in one place. It might be on to something, though it isnât clear how big that something is quite yet. The nine-month-old company says itâs currently seeing $350,000 in transaction volume every month; itâs making some undisclosed percentage of money off that amount. Read more about RevenueCat here. Why we liked it: Write code. Release app. Use RevenueCat. Get paid. That sounds like a good formula for a pretty compelling business. Indonesia is a country in transition, with a growing class of individuals with assets to invest yet who, financially, donât meet the bar set by many wealth managers. Enter Ajaib, a newly minted startup with the very bold ambition of becoming the âAnt Financial  of wealth management for Indonesia.â Why the comparison? Because China was in the same boat not long ago â a Â country whose middle class had little access to wealth management advice. With the founding of Ant Financial nearly four years ago, that changed. In fact, Ant now boasts more than 400 million users. China is home to nearly 1.4 billion, compared with Indonesia, whose population of 261 million is tiny in comparison. Still, if its plans work out to charge 1.4 percent for every dollar managed, with an estimated $370 billion in savings in the country to chase after, it could be facing a meaningful opportunity in its backyard if it gains some momentum. Why we liked it: IfÂ Ajaib’s wealth management plans (to charge 1.4 percent for every dollar it manages) work out — and with a total market of $370 billion in savings in Indonesia — the company could be facing a meaningful opportunity in its backyard.  The scooter craze is hitting Latin America andÂ GrinÂ is greasing the wheels. The Mexico City-based company was launched by co-founder Sergio Romo after he and his partner realized they werenât going to be able to get a cut of the big âbirdsâ on the scooter block in the U.S. (as Axios reported). Romo and his co-founder have already lined up a slew of investors for what may be the hottest new deal in Latin America. Backers include Sinai Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, 500 Startups, Monashees and Base10 Partners. Why we liked it:Â Scooters are so 2018. But there’s a lot of money to be made in mobility, and as the challenge from Bird and Lime to Uber  and Lyft in hyperlocal transit has revealed, there’s no dominant player that’s taken over the market… yet.  Creating animated emojis made from real photos,Â EmojerÂ just might be the most fun you can have with a camera. The companyâs software uses deep learning algorithms to detect body parts and guides users in creating their own avatars with just a simple photo take from a mobile phone. Itâs replacing deep Photoshop expertise and animation skills with a super simple interface. The avatars look very similar to Elf Yourself, a popular site that let you paste your friendsâ faces on dancing Christmas elves goes viral every year at Christmastime. Founders have PhDs in machine learning and computer vision. Why we liked it:Â As the company’s chief executive said, Snap  was for sexting, and Facebook was hot or not, so who says the next big consumer platform couldn’t be the Trojan horse of easily generated selfiemojis (akin to Elf Yourself)?  Oshâs Affordable PharmaceuticalsÂ is a public benefit corporation connecting doctors and patients with sources of low-cost, compounded pharmaceuticals. The company is looking to decrease barriers to entry for drugs for rare diseases. Three weeks ago the company introduced a drug to treat Wilsonâs Disease. There was no access to the drug that treats the disease before in Brazil, India or Canada. It slashes the cost of drugs from $30,000 a month to $120 per month. The company estimates it has a total addressable market of $17 billion. âGeneric drug pricing is a crisis, people are dying because they canât get access to the medicine they need,â says chief executive Alex Oshmyansky. Oshâs might have a solution. Why we liked it:Â Selling lower-cost medications for rare diseases in countries that previously hadn’t had access to them is a good business that’s good for the world.  Tackling a $75 billion problem of healthcare waste,Â Medinas HealthÂ is giving hospitals an easy way to resell their used supplies. The company has already raised $1 million for its marketplace to help healthcare organizations buy and sell equipment. With a seed round led by Ashton Kutcher and Guy Osearyâs Sound Ventures, and General Catalystâs Rough Draft Ventures fund, the company is also working to lower costs for cash-strapped rural healthcare centers. Why we liked it:Â Finding uses for hospital equipment that’s been lying fallow in corners is a big business. A $75 billion business if Medinas’ estimates are correct. Add helping cut costs for rural medical facilities and Medinas is a business we can get behind.  Plus-size women have limited clothing options even at the largest retailers like Nordstrom and Macyâs. While a majority of American women fall into the plus-size clothing category, 100 million women are constrained to shopping for a very small percentage of options.Â And ComfortÂ wants to solve the supply problem. To do this, the founders, two former Harvard classmates, are building a direct-to-consumer fashion brand with stylish, minimalist offerings for plus-size women, including tunic shirts and an apron dress. Itâs very early days for the brand, but since launching in recent weeks, theyâve seen $25,000 in sales. Why we liked it:Â This direct-to-consumer fashion brand is bringing higher quality, better-designed clothing options to a market that’s underserved and growing quickly. What’s not to like?  Influencers of the world are uniting on mobile app,Â ShopWith, which allows shoppers to browse virtual storefronts and aisles alongside their favorite fashion and beauty creators and YouTubers. Users can see exactly what products those influencers have featured and can buy them without ever leaving the app. Itâs a free download and hours of commercially consumptive fun. Itâs like the QVC  model, but for GenZ shoppers whose buying habits are influenced by social video content on YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat. The company revealed that one beauty influencer made $10,000 within five hours using the ShopWith platform. The founders are former product managers with experience building social commerce products at Facebook and Amazon. Why we liked it: The QVC for GenZ not only has a nice ring to it, it’s a recipe for making cash registers hum. A mobile-first, influencer-based shopping company is something that we’d definitely not call an impulse purchase.",0.021,0.878,0.101,0.9983

Some of these accounts were identified as much as a year ago. In a post by the company’s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the company described three major operations it had monitored and eventually rolled up with the help of security firm FireEye. The latter provided its own initial analysis, with more to come. Notably, few or none of these were focused on manipulating the 2018 midterm elections here in the States, but rather had a variety of topics and apparent goals. The common theme is certainly attempting to sway political opinion â just not in Ohio. For instance, a page may purport to be an organization trying to raise awareness about violence perpetrated by immigrants, but is in fact operated by a larger shadowy group attempting to steer public opinion on the topic. The networks seem to originate in Iran, and were promoting narratives including “anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes, as well as support for specific U.S. policies favorable to Iran,” as FireEye describes them. The first network Facebook describes, “Liberty Front Press,” comprised 74 pages, 70 accounts and 3 groups on Facebook, and 76 accounts on Instagram. Some 155,000 people followed at least one piece of the Facebook network and they had 48,000 Instagram followers. They were generally promoting political views in the Middle East and only recently expanded to the States; they spent $6,000 on ads beginning in January 2015 up until this month. A related network to this one also engaged in cyberattacks and hacking attempts. Its 12 pages and 66 accounts, plus nine on Instagram, were posing as news organizations. A third network had accounts going back to 2011; it was sharing content in the Middle East as well, about local, U.S. and U.K. political issues. With 168 pages, 140 Facebook accounts and 31 Instagram accounts, this was a big one. As you’ll recall, the big takedown of Russia’s IRA accounts only amounted to 135. (The full operation was of course much larger than that.) This network had 813,000 accounts following it on Facebook and 10,000 on Instagram, and had also spent about $6,000 on ads between 2012 and April of this year. Notably that means that Facebook was taking ad dollars from a network it was investigating for “coordinated inauthentic behavior.” I’ve asked Facebook to explain this â perhaps it was done so as not to tip off the network that it was under investigation. Interestingly this network also hosted 25 events, meaning it was not just a bunch of people in dark rooms posting under multiple pseudonyms and fake accounts. People attended real-life events for these pages, suggesting the accounts supported real communities despite being sockpuppets for some other organization. Twitter,  almost immediately after Facebook’s post, announced that it had banned 284 accounts for “coordinated manipulation” originating in Iran. Working with our industry peers today, we have suspended 284 accounts from Twitter for engaging in coordinated manipulation. Based on our existing analysis, it appears many of these accounts originated from Iran. — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) August 22, 2018  The Iranian networks were not alleged to be necessarily the product of state-backed operations, but of course the implication is there and not at all unreasonable. But Facebook also announced that it was removing pages and accounts “linked to sources the U.S. government has previously identified as Russian military intelligence services.” The number and nature of these accounts is not gone into in detail, except to say that their activity was focused more on Syrian and Ukrainian political issues. “To date, we have not found activity by the accounts targeting the U.S.,” the post reads. But at least the origin is relatively clear: Russian state actors. This should be a warning that it isn’t just the U.S. that is the target of coordinated disinformation campaigns online â wherever one country has something to gain by promoting a certain viewpoint or narrative, you will find propaganda and other efforts underway via whatever platforms are available. Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) issued a brief I-told-you-so following the news. “Iâve been saying for months that thereâs no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt,” he said in a statement. “We also learned today that the Iranians are now following the Kremlinâs playbook from 2016. While Iâm encouraged to see Facebook taking steps to rid their platforms of these bad actors, thereâs clearly more work to be done.” He said he plans to bring this up at the Senate Intelligence Committee’s grilling of Facebook, Twitter and Google leadership on September 5th.",0.051,0.854,0.095,0.9882

Itâs been a good one for people who want to hold Trump accountable. By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. With yesterdayâs voting in Arizona, Florida and Oklahoma, the 2018 primary season is almost over. Only five states â all in the Northeast, including Massachusetts and New York â have yet to vote, and each will do so over the next couple of weeks.  All told, the primary season has been quite good for Democrats. They have largely avoided nominating weak candidates in winnable districts. They have kept their focus on economic issues, where the public tends to support Democratic positions (as opposed to social issues or impeachment, on which voters are more evenly split). Meanwhile, President Trump continued acting in ways that have kept his approval ratings in the low 40s. Last nightâs results continued the trend. Combined, Arizona and Florida have nine House districts that Democrats have a legitimate chance to flip, according to the Cook Political Report. Solid Democratic candidates won the primaries in all nine.  In Floridaâs 15th, a suburban district, The Tampa Bay Times said that Kristen Carlson, a former prosecutor, was the best fit, and she won the nomination. In Arizonaâs 6th, outside Phoenix, a nurse practitioner named Heather Ross, who favors expanding Medicare, will face David Schweikert, a Republican incumbent who tried to repeal Obamacare â and who has ethical problems. (Primary ballots are still being counted, and the Democrat in second place, Anita Malik, is also a strong candidate.) None of this guarantees that Democrats will retake the House in November. The party will need to continue running a strong campaign and, in all likelihood, an unusually strong turnout for a midterm. But as primary season comes to a close, it has mostly helped the Democratsâ chances. Arguably, the most complicated result for Democrats last night was the one that received the most attention. In the Florida governor's primary, Andrew Gillum â the mayor of Tallahassee, endorsed by Bernie Sanders â won a victory many progressives are celebrating. Yet some political analysts think a losing candidate â Gwen Graham, a former congresswoman â had a better chance of winning the general election this fall. Even if those analysts are right, though, I think the congressional races are more important than any governorâs race. Only if Democrats retake Congress will Trump face any serious accountability for the damage he is doing, as my colleague Michelle Goldberg explained this week.  Elsewhere: Ella Nilson of Vox and Benjamin Wallace-Wells of The New Yorker profile Gillum and explain why he has excited so many people on the left.

133,Kate Conger,"In a rare sign of internal dissent, more than 100 employees have formed a group to agitate for better representation of conservative views.",2018-08-28 23:37:33,the-new-york-times,Dozens at Facebook Unite to Challenge Its ‘Intolerant’ Liberal Culture,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/technology/inside-facebook-employees-political-bias.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/business/29facebook1/29facebook1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by By Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel SAN FRANCISCO â The post went up quietly on Facebookâs internal message board last week. Titled âWe Have a Problem With Political Diversity,â it quickly took off inside the social network. âWe are a political monoculture thatâs intolerant of different views,â Brian Amerige, a senior Facebook engineer, wrote in the post, which was obtained by The New York Times. âWe claim to welcome all perspectives, but are quick to attack â often in mobs â anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology.â Since the post went up, more than 100 Facebook employees have joined Mr. Amerige to form an online group called FBâers for Political Diversity, according to two people who viewed the groupâs page and who were not authorized to speak publicly. The aim of the initiative, according to Mr. Amerigeâs memo, is to create a space for ideological diversity within the company. The new group has upset other Facebook employees, who said its online posts were offensive to minorities. One engineer, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said several people had lodged complaints with their managers about FBâers for Political Diversity and were told that it had not broken any company rules. Another employee said the group appeared to be constructive and inclusive of different political viewpoints. Mr. Amerige did not respond to requests for comment. The activity is a rare sign of organized dissent within Facebook over the companyâs largely liberal workplace culture. While the new group is just a sliver of Facebookâs work force of more than 25,000, the companyâs workers have in the past appeared less inclined than their peers at other tech companies to challenge leadership, and most have been loyalists to its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. But over the past two years, Facebook has undergone a series of crises, including the spread of misinformation by Russians on its platform and the mishandling of usersâ data. Facebook has also been accused of stifling conservative speech by President Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, among others. This month, the social network barred the far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, a move that critics seized on as further evidence that the company harbors an anti-conservative bias. Within Facebook, several employees said, people have argued over the decisions to ban certain accounts while allowing others. At staff meetings, they said, some workers have repeatedly asked for more guidance on what content the company disallows, and why. Others have said Facebook, out of fear of being seen as biased, has let too many right-wing groups flourish on the site. The dispute over employeesâ political ideology arose a week before Sheryl Sandberg, Facebookâs chief operating officer, is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing about social media manipulation in elections. A team helping Ms. Sandberg get ready for the hearing next Wednesday has warned her that some Republican lawmakers may raise questions about Facebook and biases, according to two people involved in the preparations. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump again brought up the issue of bias by tech companies with tweets attacking Google. In remarks later in the day, he widened his focus to include Twitter and Facebook. Those companies âbetter be careful because you canât do that to people,â Mr. Trump said. âI think that Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful. It is not fair to large portions of the population.â A senior Facebook engineer wrote an internal message about what he described as the companyâs âmonoculture.â Facebook has long been viewed as a predominantly liberal company. Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have donated to Democratic politicians, for example, and have supported issues such as immigration reform. The social network has sometimes struggled to integrate conservatives into its leadership. Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, the maker of virtual reality goggles that Facebook acquired, was pressured to leave the company last year, months after news spread that he had secretly donated to an organization dedicated to spreading anti-Hillary Clinton internet memes. And Peter Thiel, an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump, has faced calls for his resignation from Facebookâs board. Mr. Zuckerberg publicly defended Mr. Thiel last year, saying that he valued Mr. Thiel and that it was important to maintain diversity on the board. In an appearance before Congress this year, Mr. Zuckerberg responded to a question about anticonservative bias by saying he wanted Facebook to âbe a platform for all ideas.â In May, Facebook announced that former Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, would lead an inquiry into allegations of anticonservative bias on the social network. New employees also go through training that describes how to have respectful conversations about politics and diversity. Other Silicon Valley companies, including Google, have also experienced a wave of employee activism over diversity. If tech companies are willing to adjust their workplaces to make underrepresented groups more welcome, some employees argue, they should extend the same regard to those who do not fit the liberal-leaning Silicon Valley mold. Mr. Amerige, who started working at Facebook in 2012, said on his personal website that he followed philosophical principles laid out by the philosopher and writer Ayn Rand. He posted the 527-word memo about political diversity at Facebook on Aug. 20. On issues like diversity and immigration, he wrote, âyou can either keep quiet or sacrifice your reputation and career.â Mr. Amerige proposed that Facebook employees debate their political ideas in the new group â one of tens of thousands of internal groups that cover a range of topics â adding that this debate would better equip the company to host a variety of viewpoints on its platform. âWe are entrusted by a great part of the world to be impartial and transparent carriers of peopleâs stories, ideas and commentary,â Mr. Amerige wrote. âCongress doesnât think we can do this. The president doesnât think we can do this. And like them or not, we deserve that criticism.â Follow Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @kateconger and @sheeraf.

There is a growing sense across the political spectrum in the United States and in other countries that something must be done to rein in their influence. Executives from many of the largest internet companies will face questions next week at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about their efforts to prevent foreign meddling in the midterm elections in November, a follow-up to congressional hearings held after the 2016 elections. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebookâs chief operating officer, and Twitterâs Jack Dorsey are scheduled to testify in front of the committee. Google has also been called to testify. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate committee, has asked Google to send Sundar Pichai, its chief executive. So far, the company has offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs. Mr. Burr said he was unlikely to subpoena Mr. Pichai to testify, but that his absence would signal that Google was choosing ânot to participateâ and be âpart of the solution.â Interfering in how companies like Google and Facebook present information would be a notable departure for the federal government, which has mostly taken a hands-off approach to the internet. Free-speech scholars said companies like Google and Facebook were free to operate with few restrictions thanks to a 1996 law called the Telecommunications Act. âThat law pretty much removes free-speech liability for Google and Facebook,â said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the Newhouse School. âThat being said, I think itâd be a major leap to believe that the people behind Google are writing algorithms to discriminate against content.â Last month, regulators in Europe fined Google $5.1 billion for antitrust violations. After the European fine, Mr. Trump said Google was âone of our great companies.â What sort of pressure regulators in the United States could exert is not entirely clear. The Justice Department, under both the Trump and Obama administrations, has shown little interest in pursuing antitrust cases against Google or its parent company, Alphabet. Mr. Trump has often raised antitrust questions about another tech giant, Amazon, but little has come of his threats. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has suggested that if internet companies are not a âneutral platform,â they should not be protected by a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad legal immunity for what people put on their services. Appearing in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a vague expansion of his earlier criticism, saying that social news platforms were actively âtaking advantageâ of people. âWe have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just canât do that,â Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trumpâs claims of bias appeared to be inspired by a segment Monday night from Lou Dobbs, a host on the Fox Business Network. Mr. Dobbs highlighted an article by a conservative website, PJ Media, that said that it had conducted what it called an unscientific study in which 96 percent of Google search results for the word âTrumpâ were articles from âleft-leaning sites.â The piece was also featured on the website Drudge Report, whose operator, Matt Drudge, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. Search engine experts said Google uses many factors in its search algorithm â including how often a web page is linked to by other sites and how often certain words appear on a page â and that formula is constantly being updated. âEvery year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to usersâ queries,â the company said. âWe continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.â Even longtime Google critics disagreed with the premise of the PJ Media article. âThe industry should have plenty of concerns with Google, particularly antitrust and data collection practices, but this isnât one of them,â said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. âThe presidentâs tweets this morning are flat-out absurd.â Long before Facebook, Apple and Google had removed InfoWars from their sites, conservatives were zeroing in on Big Tech as a new enemy in the political culture wars. In February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., guests packed a ballroom for a discussion called âSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.â Although it provided a target for those in attendance, Google was a sponsor of the conference. The company held a reception for conference attendees, with an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace. Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, has followed a similar line of attack as a writer and producer of a new documentary, âThe Creepy Line,â which argues that Silicon Valley is stifling conservative content. The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion website, recently posted the trailer. During the presidential election, Trump campaign officials claimed Google was manipulating search results to favor Hillary Clinton. But right after the election, the top Google search result for âfinal election vote count 2016â was a link to a story that wrongly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, had also defeated Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote. Since then, Google has updated its search algorithm to surface what it calls âmore authoritativeâ news sources. The internet companies find themselves caught between conservatives who say they are being heavy-handed and others who say they are not doing enough to police their sites. Twitter only suspended Mr. Jonesâs account, for example, and was condemned by some of its own employees and many on the left for not being tougher. But the move by other tech giants earlier this month to ban Mr. Jones drew condemnation from a range of conservatives â even some who say they do not care for Mr. Jones. âWho the hell made Facebook the arbiter of political speech?â Mr. Cruz said in a tweet. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, has also raised concerns that Republican voices were being stifled online. He was joined by other Republican House leaders, including Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, who threatened to subpoena Twitterâs chief executive, Jack Dorsey, if he did not testify in Congress in a separate hearing on Sept. 5 on content moderation on the internet. âSocial media platforms are increasingly serving as todayâs town squares,â Mr. McCarthy said in a statement after Mr. Dorsey agreed to testify. âBut sadly, conservatives are too often finding their voices silenced.â Follow Adam Satariano, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @satariano, @daiwaka and @ceciliakang Jeremy Peters, Katie Rogers and Edmund Lee contributed reporting.

Since then, Google has updated its search algorithm to surface what it calls âmore authoritativeâ news sources. The internet companies find themselves caught between conservatives who say they are being heavy-handed and others who say they are not doing enough to police their sites. Twitter only suspended Mr. Jonesâs account, for example, and was condemned by some of its own employees and many on the left for not being tougher. But the move by other tech giants earlier this month to ban Mr. Jones drew condemnation from a range of conservatives â even some who say they do not care for Mr. Jones. âWho the hell made Facebook the arbiter of political speech?â Mr. Cruz said in a tweet. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, has also raised concerns that Republican voices were being stifled online. He was joined by other Republican House leaders, including Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, who threatened to subpoena Twitterâs chief executive, Jack Dorsey, if he did not testify in Congress in a separate hearing on Sept. 5 on content moderation on the internet. âSocial media platforms are increasingly serving as todayâs town squares,â Mr. McCarthy said in a statement after Mr. Dorsey agreed to testify. âBut sadly, conservatives are too often finding their voices silenced.â Follow Adam Satariano, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @satariano, @daiwaka and @ceciliakang Jeremy Peters, Katie Rogers and Edmund Lee contributed reporting.

136,THE EDITORIAL BOARD,A United Nations panel calls out Myanmar’s persecution of its Rohingya minority and says six top military commanders should be held to account.,2018-08-28 00:35:20,the-new-york-times,‘The Gravest Crimes Under International Law’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/opinion/rohingya-myanmar-genocide-united-nations.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/27/opinion/27rohingyaWeb/27rohingyaWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by A United Nations panel calls out Myanmarâs persecution of its Rohingya minority and says six top military commanders should be held to account. By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. It has taken a long time â too long â to fully acknowledge the terrible suffering of the Rohingya people at the hands of Myanmarâs military rulers, perhaps because of the worldâs reluctance to jeopardize their tentative political opening. A newly released United Nations report should put an end to any hesitation about holding the generals, and their civilian enablers, to account for what they have done: genocide and crimes against humanity. Genocide is the most serious charge that can be leveled against a regime. It means, in effect, the premeditated destruction of a people, and for all the denials and evasions of Myanmarâs generals, that is what they have tried to do to the Rohingya Muslims, which has been condoned by the failure of civilian leaders â including the once-revered Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi â to speak out. In the 18-page report released on Monday, the three-member United Nations Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar declared that the atrocities committed by the military in their campaign to cleanse Myanmar of the Rohingya âundoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law.â The panel said estimates of 10,000 deaths in the campaign were conservative and cited witness accounts of mass killings, gang rapes and destruction of villages by the military. More than a million Rohingya are believed to be living in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.  The Rohingya are a Muslim minority that has lived for generations in Myanmar and yet has been long treated by the Buddhist majority as interlopers from Bangladesh and denied citizenship and basic rights. In recent years, tens of thousands fled to Bangladesh to escape violence. The ethnic cleansing reached a new level a year ago, after Rohingya militants attacked Myanmar security posts. According to the United Nations panel, the militaryâs response was far out of proportion, indicating a premeditated campaign. Military necessity, the panel wrote, âwould never justify killing indiscriminately, gang-raping women, assaulting children and burning entire villages.â The panel also assailed the virulent hate speech against the Rohingya on social platforms, notably Facebook. Facebook subsequently said it was taking additional steps to block the propaganda. Most of the atrocities detailed by the report have been described before. But the panelâs charge of genocide, and the naming of six senior military figures, including the commander in chief of the armed forces and his deputy, raised accusations that cannot be neglected by the international community. Myanmar itself will not act, as the military and civilian authorities have made clear in their denials and phony internal investigations. The United Nations fact-finding mission lacks the power to bring charges before the International Criminal Court or to set up an international tribunal, and any such action by the Security Council would most likely be blocked by China, Myanmarâs patron. But there are other remedies: sanctions, travel bans, a freeze on the assets of those named. The European Union has scheduled a meeting with the United Nations team this week; earlier this month the United States imposed sanctions on several Myanmar security officers and two military units, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would continue to hold accountable those responsible for âabhorrent ethnic cleansingâ of Rohingya Muslims. However it is done, the Myanmar generals and their civilian enablers must be held to account and the terrible persecution of the Rohingya brought to an end.

137,Janet Morrissey,"Wearable apps can help women determine their most fertile days each month. Despite numerous successes, not all doctors are convinced they actually work.",2018-08-27 14:01:27,the-new-york-times,Women Struggling to Get Pregnant Turn to Fertility Apps,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/business/women-fertility-apps-pregnancy.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/27/business/27healthcare2-3/27healthcare2-3-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by By Janet Morrissey When Nicole and Christopher Roberts of North Stonington, Conn., decided to start a family in 2016, Nicole quickly became pregnant, but then miscarried three months later. Getting pregnant a second time became far tougher than they expected. Mrs. Roberts, 32, started taking neonatal vitamins, tracking her menstrual cycle carefully, taking over-the-counterovulation tests, and even trying a few wacky internet suggestions, such as putting her legs up in the air after sex and not moving for half an hour. âIt didnât work,â she said. âAs the months dragged on, there was a feeling of desperation because we wanted it so badly.â Then she saw an ad for Ava, a Fitbit-like device thatâs worn on the wrist at night and uses sensors to identify the five fertile days in a womanâs monthly cycle to improve her odds of conception. âIt almost felt too good to be true,â Mrs. Roberts said. She started using the device in March 2017, was pregnant by June, and gave birth to Amelia this year on March 19. Mrs. Roberts is among a growing number of women who are seeking out fertility apps and wearable devices, like Ava, to help grow their families. âWeâre now living in a society where there is a cultural influence that everyone can get pregnant after five glasses of tequila in one night. Thatâs what Hollywood shows us all the time,â said Lea von Bidder, co-founder and president of Ava. âBut the reality is very different.â Busy lifestyles have made it tougher for working couples to find the time to track menstrual cycles, take ovulation tests, measure their daily temperature, and then make that all-important physical connection at just the right time in the cycle to create a baby. Also, many women, especially among millennials, are focusing on careers and putting off marriage and children until later, which poses additional challenges as conception rates are lower in older women. âFor a 28-year-old woman, roughly 10 of the 12 eggs she releases each year are viable,â Ms. Von Bidder said. âBut for a 38-year old woman, perhaps only two of the 12 eggs will be viable.â So pinpointing those fertile days becomes even more critical. The birthrate among women under 30 has been falling steadily since 2010 while the rate among women in their late 30s, 40s and 50s has been rising, according to National Center for Health statistics. âIn my mind, if you had [unprotected] sex, you got pregnant and that was it,â said Kate Campbell, a 32-year-old Nashville resident, who was measuring her body temperature and taking ovulation tests twice a day for months to try to conceive â without success. âI wasnât getting any positives. I was really shocked. How do people get pregnant by accident?â After purchasing an Ava bracelet in April 2017, she discovered she had been missing her fertility window by about a week because her cycles were longer than normal and regular period-tracking apps didnât pick that up. By August, she was pregnant, and her son, Canaan James, was born on April 27, 2018. The internet is filled with women on forums, Facebook and videos seeking fertility advice. They say the problem is highly misunderstood and deeply underestimated. âFor someone, especially a family member, to say, âWell, are you doing it right?â or âDo you know what youâre doing?â â I know theyâre joking â but itâs not funny to me. Itâs just rude,â said a woman who identifies herself as Jolene Grizzle in a YouTube video, as she described her struggle with fertility, which included using Ava. (It didnât work for her.) The Ava bracelet collects data on nine parameters, including skin temperature, resting pulse rate, breathing, sleep movement, and stress levels, while the woman sleeps. Once the bracelet is synced to the personâs phone in the morning, Avaâs proprietary algorithm achieves an 89 percent accuracy rate at detecting 5.3 fertile days each cycle, according to the company. By measuring temperature and other variables, Ava is able to track changes in both progesterone and estrodial levels, Ms. Von Bidder said. âI didnât have to worry about peeing on a stick and stressing out,â said Krystal Noon, a 30-year old Branchville, N.J., resident, who struggled for months to conceive before using Ava. âI would just put this bracelet on at night and it does all the work,â said Mrs. Noon, who conceived two months after using Ava. Since its introduction in 2016, Ms. Von Bidder said, 10,000 Ava customers have become pregnant and at least 1,000 have given birth. Sales are on track to triple this year, she added. But Ava isnât for everyone. Itâs limited to women with cycles between 24 and 35 days, and is not for those with PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome, who face hormone imbalances and highly irregular cycles. And Ava has some competitors. Some are free apps, like Glow, Clue, Period Tracker Lite, and Flo, which are generally period trackers that rely on a woman to input her cycle data, then estimate the fertile time based on a calendar or rhythm method. There are also fertility monitors, like Kindara/Wink and Daysy, that come with an app and thermometer. And there are a few wearables, like Bellabeatâs Leaf pendant, Duo Fertilityâs sensor thatâs worn under the arm, Yonoâs in-ear sensor, and Tempdropâs underarm sensor. But none track all of the parameters that Ava does, Ms. Von Bidder said. âBecause we measure more physiological parameters than just temperature, we can actually detect the fertile window earlier and with a higher accuracy.â. One wearable, OvuSense, is worn like a tampon and measures temperature and other factors. Its readings are considered more accurate than those taken by external devices and can even predict ovulation days for people with PCOS. However, the device is more intrusive than wearing an Ava bracelet. âI would be a little bit more leery of it because that sounds a little more invasive,â said Tara Perez, a 34-year-old Cartersville, Ga., resident who used the Ava bracelet to help conceive. A big Ava perk is its wildly popular Facebook groups, where 25,000 registered Ava users ask questions, share experiences and encourage each other. âThat community of women is unlike any youâve ever seen before,â said Mrs. Perez, who credits the group with helping her through her fertility struggles. Mrs. Perez said family members had told her she likely would never be able to have children because she was Type 1 diabetic. But the Ava community helped and encouraged her through the loss of one baby to heart failure at 34 weeks and another through a form of early miscarriage, or âchemical pregnancy,â at five weeks â before giving birth to a healthy baby girl, Selene, on May 30, this year. Still, Ava has its skeptics. On Reddit, some questioned Avaâs efficacy, given that it had been tested on only 41 women in its original trial. Then thereâs Avaâs $249 price tag. âWhile it was expensive, it was a whole lot less expensive than trying to look into something like in vitro or trying to ovulate via medication,â Mrs. Perez said. Some critics noted that none of the fertility apps and devices have proven data that shows they significantly shorten the time it takes for a woman to become pregnant. âNone of them have undergone time-to-pregnancy studies,â said Dr. Victoria Jennings, director of Georgetown Universityâs Institute for Reproductive Health. âBut it wonât stop women from using them or the developers from promoting them.â Ava has raised $42.3 million in financing. And Pascal Koenig, chief executive and co-founder of Ava, said three studies were underway, including one with more than 430 participants, on expanding Avaâs use to include detecting infections during pregnancy, helping women with highly irregular cycles and helping perimenopausal women. Dr. Zev Williams, chief of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility at Columbia University Medical Center, sees value in both fertility apps and wearables. Even a basic app can help a woman see if her cycles are seriously irregular and require medical attention, he said. But heâs particularly interested in Ava. âIt seems pretty sophisticated,â said Dr. Williams, who is in talks with the company about doing a more extensive joint study on the device. âWe have an overarching goal of trying to make fertility treatment easier for women and couples going through it, and if this worked out, it would have the potential to do that.â   Advertisement",0.057,0.863,0.08,0.9873
138,DAVID LEONHARDT,Today’s Republican Party is the biggest threat to the country that McCain served and loved. He offered an alternative.,2018-08-26 22:56:38,the-new-york-times,John McCain’s Parting Message: Our Greatness Is in Peril,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/26/opinion/john-mccain-republican-party-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/26/opinion/26leonhardt1/26leonhardt1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by Todayâs Republican Party is the biggest threat to the country that McCain served and loved. He offered an alternative. By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist John McCain was no moderate. He won Barry Goldwaterâs Arizona seat in 1986 and was, for the most part, a fitting heir to Goldwater. McCain supported a smaller federal government, a hawkish foreign policy and the typical Republican positions on abortion, guns and other issues.  But McCain pursued his conservative ends through means that are depressingly rare in todayâs Republican Party. McCain believed in the American ideals of pluralistic democracy. He despised autocracy. He was willing to accept defeat when his side lost a political battle. He pushed for an election system not dominated by the wealthy. He came to reject racism as a political strategy. And in his dying months, McCain was one of the only Republicans to oppose President Trump not just with his words, but also with his vote. In a recent New Yorker essay about Charles de Gaulle, Adam Gopnik described the French leader in ways that left me thinking about McCainâs legacy. âHis life is proof that unapologetic right-wing politics do not necessarily bend toward absolutism,â Gopnik wrote. âThey can also sometimes stiffen the spine of liberal democracy.â The absolutism and radicalism of todayâs Republican Party is the biggest threat to the country that McCain served and loved. It has left the United States impotent to deal with our greatest challenges â inequality, alienation, climate change and a global drift toward autocracy. Congress, as McCain said last year, is âgetting nothing done.â Meanwhile, threats to American power and interests grow.  I expect the Trump presidency to end poorly for Republicans, in some combination of disgrace, unpopularity and defeat. If it does, at least some Republicans will be looking for ways to reinvent their party. They will want an antidote to Trumpism, a set of ideas that manage to be conservative and anti-Trump.  They could do a lot worse than a version of McCainism. Iâm well aware that McCain could be maddeningly inconsistent and flawed. He equivocated about the Confederate flag in 2000. He too often acquiesced to Mitch McConnellâs torching of Senate norms. For goodness sake, McCain decided Sarah Palin should be vice president. As he himself admitted, he should have done much more to fight Republican extremism. But the sum total of his career still represents a meaningful alternative to Trump, McConnell and the rest of todayâs Republican leadership. At McCainâs best, as Barack Obama said this weekend, he displayed âa fidelity to something higher â the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed.â What would a Republican Party more in the mold of John McCain look like?  It would, for starters, stop cowing to Trump and stand up for American national security. It would investigate Russian cyberattacks and the possibility, as McCain put it, âthat the president of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion.â Many of McCainâs colleagues remembering him as a brave patriot are proving themselves to be neither.  Second, a more McCain-like Republican Party would understand that racism is both immoral and, in the long term, politically ruinous. McCain had a multiracial family â the kind that is increasingly Americaâs future. Rather than scapegoat immigrants, he took risks to pass immigration reform. After Charlottesville, he declared, âWhite supremacists arenât patriots, theyâre traitors.â  Third, McCain believed in democracy and its vital, fragile institutions. He accepted his two haunting presidential defeats honorably. He has reportedly chosen the victors in those campaigns â Obama and George W. Bush â to deliver eulogies at his funeral. Most significantly, McCain fought for campaign-finance laws to reduce the influence of plutocrats. Fourth, McCain understood that democracy sometimes means moving on. He voted against Obamacare â a reflection of his small-government conservatism. But he also voted, crucially, against its repeal â a reflection of his small-c conservatism. In doing so, he acted as a modern-day Eisenhower, a Republican willing to accept an expansion of the safety net for the good of the country.  Finally, McCain recognized that the military wasnât the only way that Washington could use its awesome power for good. When I interviewed him during the 2008 presidential campaign, he described his economic hero as Theodore Roosevelt â a âfree-enterprise, capitalist, full-bore guyâ who realized that prosperity depended on government agencies âthat need to do their job as well.â The outlook led him to favor policies (albeit too sporadically) to fight climate change and expand community colleges.  Imagine how different our politics could be if even some Republicans â Ã  la T.R. â occasionally took the side of the little guy against corporate behemoths. And even if you disagreed with McCain on as many issues as I did, imagine if the Republican Party ultimately came to resemble him more than Trump. Above all, McCain believed in American greatness â as a reality, not a slogan. He knew that the United States could play a unique role in the world, as a defender of freedom and human dignity. He also knew that the role was anything but assured. It required hard work, good choices, compromise and sacrifice.  McCainâs final message for his country was a warning: Our greatness is in peril.

Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was in Russia on an arms-buying expedition. Starting a year ago, more than 700,000 Rohingya began fleeing Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh amid a frenzy of massacre, rape and arson by soldiers and Buddhist mobs â acts of violence that have been widely documented. [Read here an account of how a civilian Rakhine town administrator conducted a campaign of torture and abuse of his Rohingya constituents for years before leading soldiers in a massacre.] Yet since then, General Min Aung Hlaing and Myanmarâs other leaders have escaped international legal censure. And they are maintaining a campaign of denial and avoidance, as well as jailing and intimidating reporters who have documented the attacks. On Tuesday, while Myanmarâs commander in chief was shopping for weaponry in Russia, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the countryâs de facto civilian leader, gave a speech in Singapore in which she made no mention of the bloodletting by the nationâs armed forces. Thousands of Rohingya are believed to have been killed in northern Rakhine State. United Nations officials have raised the prospect that the violence could be considered genocide, and officials at the United States State Department have debated using the term, according to American diplomats. But Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, blamed âterrorist activities, which was the initial cause of events leading to the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine.â On Aug. 25, 2017, Rohingya militants, mostly armed with makeshift weapons, carried out strikes on police posts and an army station in northern Rakhine, killing a dozen security forces. Myanmarâs military, which is known as the Tatmadaw, says that its actions were âclearance operations,â in response to the Rohingya raids. But human rights groups have documented how the nationâs military dispatched truckloads of soldiers to northern Rakhine even in the weeks before the Aug. 25 insurgent strike. In a question-and-answer session after her lecture in Singapore, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father founded Myanmarâs modern army, said that she found the generals in her cabinet to be ârather sweet.â Sidestepping a question about the safety concerns that Rohingya sheltering in Bangladesh had about returning home, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi focused on Rakhineâs tourism potential, calling the state âthe most beautiful region in Myanmar.â âAll of the foreigners I have ever met frequently told me that the beaches in Rakhine State are more attractive than those across the world,â she said. The United States, Canada and the European Union have placed targeted sanctions on Myanmar military officers believed to have directed the violence against the largely stateless Rohingya last year. But General Min Aung Hlaing and other top brass were spared. Others are pushing for Myanmar to be formally investigated for war crimes. On Friday, a group of 132 Southeast Asian lawmakers called on the United Nations Security Council to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court, which rules on genocide and mass atrocity crimes. âOne year has passed since the Myanmar military launched its murderous operation in Rakhine State, yet we are no closer to seeing those responsible brought to justice,â said Charles Santiago, a member of the Malaysian Parliament. âAs Myanmar is clearly both unwilling and unable to investigate itself, we are now at a stage where the international community must step in to ensure accountability.â Myanmar is not a signatory to the treaty that established the International Criminal Court, but the Security Council has the power to begin the process of judicial action. On Monday, the Security Council is scheduled to discuss the ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. But China and Russia, two permanent members of the United Nations body, have often shielded Myanmar from formal condemnation. Myanmar purchases military equipment from both countries. China has invested heavily in Myanmarâs natural resources, particularly in areas where ethnic minorities live, such as Rakhine State. General Min Aung Hlaing has been at a military forum in Russia over the past week. Early during his visit, he toured a Moscow exhibition hall filled with more than 26,000 pieces of weaponry and other military equipment and enjoyed a âdynamic displayâ of tanks, planes and armored vehicles, according to a post on his Facebook page. Myanmarâs commander in chief thanked Russia for its âcooperation in training and military technology between the two armed forces, cooperation in antiterrorism, support and assistance for Myanmar in solving the problems in northern Rakhine State,â said the Facebook post. Part of the focus on Myanmarâs actions has been its practice of razing whole Rohingya villages and leveling the landscape, in essence trying to erase history. On a recent visit by journalists from The New York Times to Myin Hlut, one such village in Rakhine State, tropical foliage had reclaimed what was once a place of human habitation, vines curling up concrete posts and smothering the scorched foundations of homes. The road was lined with charred palm trees and the carcasses of burned-out mosques. One Rohingya native of that village, Zahidullah Rahim, is now a refugee languishing in a camp in Bangladesh. In an interview there, he said he once hoped to become a lawyer to help represent his people. Now, he struggles with the idea that the home he once knew had been obliterated, in an act this year by Myanmar authorities that was documented by satellite imagery. âEverything has disappeared,â he said, âeven my dreams.â Myanmar has one of the largest armies in Southeast Asia. A military junta ruled the country for nearly half a century, placing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for 15 years. The current Myanmar government, which is composed of a hybrid military-civilian leadership, has formed half a dozen commissions to look into the violence in northern Rakhine. But apart from one specific case and a handful of firings or demotions, no individuals have been held accountable for mass rapes, killings and village burnings. That one case, the massacre of 10 Rohingya men in the village of Inn Din, was documented by Reuters in a report published in February. Seven soldiers who took part in the executions were sentenced to 10 years in prison. In April, a Myanmar television network announced on its website that the men had been released in a prisoner amnesty before the news was abruptly taken offline. Two of the Reuters journalists whose reporting was integral to the Inn Din story are in jail, on trial for violating Myanmarâs Official Secrets Act. Their verdict is expected on Monday, and they could face up to 14 years in prison if convicted. Saw Nang contributed reporting. Advertisement",0.096,0.842,0.062,-0.9932

But what if going to bed in the wee hours is actually an advantage? By Alex Williams I hate that Delta Air Lines commercial, the one called â4 a.m.,â that mocks me from my in-seat screen.  It starts off with a montage of perky professionals, rising before dawn in homes and executive-class hotel rooms around the world, stretching their gym-toned bodies and firing up coffeepots at an hour usually reserved for mating fruit bats. âHereâs to all 180 million of you early risers, go-getters and should-be sleepers,â the voice-over says, as Disneyâs âHeigh-Hoâ swells in the background. âBecause the ones who truly change the world are the ones who canât wait to get out in it.â  Yes, I get it. I have heard this all my life: Society likes morning people. Loves them, actually. Early risers tend to be more punctual, get better grades in school and climb up the corporate ladder. These so-called larks are celebrated as the high achievers, the apple polishers, the C.E.O.s.  Itâs basically the idea that Ben Franklin touted more than 250 years ago â âearly to bed, early to riseâ â with everyone else cast as lazy or self-indulgent. But what if they are wrong? What if night owls are actually the unsung geniuses? What if we are the ultimate disrupters and rule changers, the ones who are better suited to a modern, postindustrial society ruled by late-night coders, digital nomads, freelance moguls and co-working entrepreneurs? Perhaps it is finally time for the night owls of the world to rise! (Just not too early, of course.) I knew I was different by the time I was 7 or 8. My parentsâ efforts to get me to sleep by 7:30 p.m. were pointless.  I have painful memories of those nights, lying wide-awake with the lights out, my mind whirring as I watching the minutes on my old digital clock grind by â 30 minutes, 60, 90. Only my hamster Stuart shared my nocturnal proclivities, rattling along on his squeaky wheel in the darkness.  Things got worse in my teens. My father, who was an extreme lark, would wake up by 6:30 a.m. and storm into my room, huffing, âSociety starts at dawn,â as he yanked off my bedcover.  He was not wrong. Schools, office jobs and sports leagues were all designed around a larkâs schedule. And there was nothing I could do about it.  The notion that I could simply reset my internal wiring with a little self-discipline seemed patently false, likely damaging.  Keep in mind that my sleep hygiene, to invoke a term that had not yet come into vogue, was excellent. I didnât touch alcohol or caffeine, and found it easy to avoid screen time before bedtime, since the only screen in my house was a cathode-tube television serving up dreck like âJoanie Loves Chachi.â Years later, sleep doctors would diagnose me with what is commonly called delayed sleep phase syndrome, which refers to anyone who goes to sleep hours later than the, ahem, âconventionalâ time. The condition is often boiled down to scary sounding initials â D.S.P.S. â like so many life-threatening diseases.  And I have it fairly bad. My body naturally wants to go to bed around 2 a.m. and rise around 10 a.m. Whenever I try to adjust to an early schedule, my brain is like mush. Conversely, I light up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree around 9 p.m., and for the next few hours I am my most me: alert, clever, inspired to create. Not that society has ever shown much flexibility toward my sleep cycle. I have had an office job for most of my adult life, and I am now married with two children under 10, so I regularly rise by 7:30 a.m., doing my best to fake some Fred Rogers good cheer as I pack lunches and get our sons off to school.  As a result, I suffer chronic sleep deficit. That is, I have a so-called sleep problem, although technically, that is not accurate.  I sleep fine. It is everyone else who has a problem with it.  My blue-pill moment came earlier this year, when I read âWhy We Sleep,â by Matthew Walker, the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California at Berkeley.  The book details how every human runs on a 24-hour circadian rhythm, an internal clock, which coordinates a drop in body temperature, for example, as it prepares for slumber, and cranks back up when it is time to wake. What larks like my father never understood is that not everyoneâs clock is the same.  According to Dr. Walker, about 40 percent of the population are morning people, 30 percent are evening people, and the remainder land somewhere in between. âNight owls are not owls by choice,â he writes. âThey are bound to a delayed schedule by unavoidable DNA hard wiring. It is not their conscious fault, but rather their genetic fate.â  (For further proof, researchers at Rockefeller University last year announced the discovery of a gene mutation that apparently accounts for D.S.P.S., meaning that I am, I suppose, a mutant, just like Godzilla and The Toxic Avenger).  When night owls are forced to rise early, their prefrontal cortex, which controls sophisticated thought processes and logical reasoning, âremains in a disabled, or âoffline,â state,â Dr. Walker writes. âLike a cold engine in an early-morning start, it takes a long time before it warms up to operating temperature.â  That might even serve an evolutionary purpose. When early humans lived in small tribes, as in the early scenes of â2001: A Space Odyssey,â staggered sleep schedules bestowed a survival advantage: Someone was always awake to watch for prowling leopards and club-wielding rivals, according to the book.  But it has been downhill for us night owls ever since. The rise of agriculture brought fields to till at daybreak. The industrial revolution brought factories with 8 a.m. time clocks. Night owls were forced to adapt, and that appears to have taken a toll. According to a much-publicized study of chronotypes published this year, night owls may die earlier than morning people. Another study, in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, found that night owls are 6 percent more likely to suffer depression than people who slept conventional hours. Various studies have suggested that night owls also drink more, smoke more and have more sex partners (perhaps because it is easier to get lucky at a bar at midnight than in a Starbucks at 7 a.m.). Other research has drawn links to the dark triad of personality disorders: psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism.  I certainly know what it is like to burn the candle at both ends. When I graduated from college, I found the morning rhythms of office life to be an eye-opener â though not literally, of course.  At my first job, as a newspaper reporter in Orange County, Calif., I was required to be at my desk at 8 a.m. I held that job for 14 months, taking only one week of vacation, but my body never acclimated.  Night after night I would lie awake until 1 a.m. or later, freaking out about my inevitable exhaustion the next day, as the Santa Ana winds violently rustled the Italian Cypress trees outside my bedroom window.  Even when I dragged myself in at 7:45 a.m., my boss had already been there for an hour, because bosses rise at the crack of dawn, right? Thatâs why they are bosses. In the corporate world, rising early has always served as a handy signifier of unbridled ambition, the will to succeed.  Among C-suite executives, that tradition is alive and well. Robert Iger of Disney, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Indra Nooyi, the departing chief executive of PepsiCo, are all said to rise between 4 and 4:30, and they are relative lazy slobs compared with Tim Cook of Apple, who reportedly bounds out of bed at 3:45 a.m. No surprise that âemployees who started work earlier in the day were rated by their supervisors as more conscientious, and thus received higher performance ratings,â according to a 2014 study by the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington.  Itâs the old âdress like your bossâ formula for success, but with chronotypes, not clothes.  But what if the modern-day workplace no longer operates under that formula? What if being a night owl is no longer a handicap, but an asset? âI was never a morning person,â Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, said in a 2016 Facebook video interview with Jerry Seinfeld. He reportedly rises around 8 a.m., hours later than traditional executives, but perfectly in line with hacker hours that prevail in Silicon Valley.  âThe most productive coders I know â and writers and probably a lot of other creatives,â said Tim Ferriss, the life-hacking author and tech investor, âtend to do a lot of their best work when others are asleep, at times that coincide with the fewest inbound distractions.â  Tech entrepreneurs are even advertising their night owl tendencies as a status symbol.  Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, told Fast Company that he usually sleeps between 3 and 10 a.m. âI donât use many apps,â he said. âI use naps.â  Another next-generation tech titan, Alexis Ohanian of Reddit, is similarly boastful about his late hours, saying that he usually goes to bed around 2 a.m. and rises around 10 a.m., or whenever when his cat wakes him. The traditional 9-to-5 workplace is starting to fall out of favor, especially in Silicon Valley and creative sectors where the workday is no longer tied to daylight hours. And, with robots and artificial intelligence further eroding the old system by taking over the routine tasks, the new workplace culture is less about punctuality and more about creativity and breaking the rules.  Say what you will about night owls, but we are a tribe of mavericks. Our hall of fame â or infamy â includes rebels (Keith Richards, Hunter S. Thompson) and revolutionaries (Mao, Stalin), mad geniuses (James Joyce, Prince) and madmen (Charles Manson, Hitler). Even our conventional political heroes (Barack Obama, Winston Churchill) are remembered as genius outsiders.  This may not be a coincidence. The very essence of our chronotype makes us oddballs, prone to looking at life through a different lens. We are the weirdos who feel most alive skulking through the darkness, secure in the illusion that we own the world for at least a few precious hours every night while everyone else slumbers.  In those wee hours, we feel the freedom to think any thought, dream any dream, safe from the scrutiny and judgment of the strait-laced world.  Does that mean we are, in fact, narcissists? Perhaps. We are at least different. Maybe special.  At least a few scientists agree. In 2009, Satoshi Kanazawa, a provocative evolutionary psychologist from the London School of Economics and Political Science, inspired many headlines with a study that attempted to suggest that night owls may be more intelligent than larks.  Other researchers have suggested that we are preternaturally wired to take risks, a quality that I tend to associate with entrepreneurial verve. A 2014 University of Chicago study found that night owls were âassociated with greater general risk-takingâ in matters of finance, ethics and leisure.  Granted, those traits may add up to embezzler as much as disrupter, but after a lifetime of hearing negatives about our chronotype, Iâll take what I can get. It would certainly make my life easier if scientists somehow proved that night owls were a teensy bit smarter and a weensy bit bolder. But I donât think you have to go there to feel good about our chances.  Corporate America is already catching up. Some 80 percent of companies now offer some form of flexible work arrangements, according to a 2015 survey by WorldatWork, a nonprofit human resources association, and FlexJobs, a career site.  For many workers, this means âfreedom from a crushing commute, from an interruption-filled office, from a 9-to-5 straitjacket,â said David Heinemeier Hansson, a tech entrepreneur and an author of the book âRemote: Office Not Required.â For night owls, this is huge. No longer must armies of professionals arbitrarily be rousted at daybreak, like groggy recruits heeding a bugle blowing reveille.  Indeed, late risers are organizing. Camilla Kring, a Danish business consultant and author, founded B-Society, a night owl advocacy group that is lobbying to end daylight saving time, promote flexible work schedules and adjust start times in schools, âto support different human chronotypes.â  âCompanies can use the knowledge about circadian rhythms as a competitive advantage,â Ms. Kring said. And maybe they already are. The term âchronotype diversityâ is starting to find traction, as business managers explore concepts like team energetic asynchrony: staggered work schedules to make sure all workers are working at peak efficiency.  It is about time. Letâs say the whole world finally wakes up to the idea that we night owls are more than laggards and sleepyheads. Fast-forward to 2025, say, and I settle into my seat on a Delta flight, perhaps a supersonic one, to be greeted by a new commercial. It starts off with a montage of perky professionals in executive-class hotel rooms around the world, firing up the kettle for chamomile tea and furiously tapping away at laptops as they race to meet deadlines at an hour usually reserved for James Cordenâs âCarpool Karaoke.â  âHereâs to all 180 million of you late risers, night crawlers and canât-get-to-sleepers,â the voice-over says, as Eric Claptonâs âAfter Midnightâ swells in the background. âBecause the ones who truly change the world are the ones who are still at it when everyone else is fast asleep.â  Advertisement",0.051,0.847,0.101,0.999

He tended to dairy cows on a farm owned by a prominent family and returned home each evening to a modest brown trailer along a gravel road outside town. But Mr. Bahena Riveraâs quiet demeanor sometimes stood out in jarring ways. A neighbor said he did not always follow the local custom of acknowledging him when Mr. Bahena Rivera drove by in a Chevy Malibu. And, more alarmingly, a woman said he made her uncomfortable with a romantic advance and repeated Facebook messages in the middle of the night. âHe would just stare. He wouldnât really like talk,â said the woman, Brooke Bestell, 20, who had turned Mr. Bahena Rivera down when he asked her out on a date. âSomething about him was off.â Over the course of this week, Mr. Bahena Rivera, 24, went from a quiet farmworker whose real name was unknown, even to his employer, to a homicide suspect whose arrest inflamed the national immigration debate. President Trump has cited the first-degree murder charge against Mr. Bahena Rivera as proof of the need for tougher border security. Iowa politicians and conservative news outlets have seized on the case as ammunition as Novemberâs election nears. And here in Brooklyn, population 1,400, residents have struggled to understand how the man they saw at the grocery store could be tied to the death of Mollie Tibbetts, a psychology student and summer camp counselor who disappeared last month while out for a jog. Mr. Bahena Rivera, who is jailed on a $5 million cash bond, was one of many Mexicans who have made their way to Iowaâs pastures, where farmers often struggle to find eligible workers to tend their crops and cattle. Mr. Bahena Rivera grew up in El Guayabillo, a village of unpaved roads some three hoursâ drive from Acapulco on Mexicoâs Pacific Coast, and attended the only elementary school in the village of about 400 people. âA very good person, a simple guy with no vices,â Victor Manuel NuÃ±ez Carbajal, who attended school with Mr. Bahena Rivera, said in a Facebook message. Neighbors told Univision network that his father tended his small corn plot and also milked dairy cows in the village, earning less than $10 a day. Mr. Bahena Rivera came to the United States at age 17, his lawyer said, with the equivalent of a middle school education. After a few years at another farm, he went to work at Yarrabee Farms outside Brooklyn, which is co-owned by Craig Lang, a former Republican candidate for Iowa agriculture secretary. âI would say he always did his work on time,â Mr. Lang said. âBut he wasnât much for conversation.â His lawyer, Allan M. Richards, said Mr. Bahena Rivera had been a law-abiding employee since arriving in the United States. âHeâs here living the American dream and working seven days a week, 12 hours a day, and trying to do his best at his job,â Mr. Richards said. He said Mr. Bahena Riveraâs family members were not yet willing to speak publicly. Federal officials said they have no record of Mr. Bahena Rivera entering the country legally and said that he appeared to have used false documents to obtain employment. The sheriffâs department in Poweshiek County said it had not interacted with him until this week. Neither had any state law enforcement agencies in Iowa. Mr. Lang said Mr. Bahena Rivera had been hired at the farm in August 2014 after presenting a valid Social Security number, which was checked with a federal database, and a state-issued identification card. The new employee was known around town as Cristhian Bahena Rivera, but around the farm by the fraudulent name listed on those documents, a name the authorities did not disclose. Outside of work, Mr. Bahena Rivera started dating a Brooklyn high school student, Iris Monarrez, whom he met in 2013. Around 2014, they had a daughter. And for about a year, they lived together. Mr. Bahena Rivera once posted on Facebook that the day he met his girlfriend was âel mejor dÃ­a de mi vida,â or âthe best day of my life.â When she posted a photo of herself in 2015, he wrote in Spanish, âMy beautiful cool princess.â âHe was really romantic,â said Aby Felix, a second cousin of Ms. Monarrez, who she said has been separated from Mr. Bahena Rivera for about two years. âHe would bring her flowers.â Residents said Mr. Bahena Rivera was an attentive father who was often seen playing with his daughter in the city park. His arrest has rattled Brooklyn, a small town where most everybody knows everybody else, and where many had assumed someone from outside the community was responsible for Ms. Tibbettsâs disappearance on July 18. Ms. Tibbetts, a student at the University of Iowa known as a talented writer, had attended high school in Brooklyn and was known for her frequent jogs around her hometown. After weeks of investigating and national news coverage, police found security video that showed a dark-colored Malibu driving back and forth as she ran on the day of her disappearance. The Malibu was later tied to Mr. Bahena Rivera, who police said cooperated and led them to her body after being taken into custody on Monday. A medical examiner said Ms. Tibbetts, whose funeral is Sunday, died in a homicide from âmultiple sharp force injuries.â Many here said they felt terrible both for the Tibbetts family and for Ms. Monarrez, who could not be reached for an interview and whose Facebook page has been flooded with vitriolic messages from outside Iowa. Some in Brooklyn were perplexed by the arrest of a man many knew as a familiar, if unremarkable, face around town. Mary Jo Seaton, a former owner of a Brooklyn grocery store, said he often stopped by her store in the late afternoon or early evening, usually with two other young men she presumed to be his co-workers. âThey would be talking to each other, smiling, laughing, and if you spoke to them or said hi, they would smile back at you,â Ms. Seaton said. Because they spoke Spanish and most store employees did not, she said, they did not talk at length with staff. âI thought he seemed like a very nice person â a clean-cut, American person,â Ms. Seaton said. Others found his behavior more troubling. Ms. Bestell, the acquaintance who declined a date with him, said he would not make conversation when she encountered him in person, but he would send repeated social media messages over a period of months. âJust over and over, like every week or so, he would message me again,â Ms. Bestell said, including as recently as June 13 at 3 a.m. After he was arrested, two of Ms. Bestellâs friends told her that he had also messaged them online over the years. âI donât know how many other girls he probably was trying to talk to,â she said.

142,BRET STEPHENS,President Bill Clinton spoke to reporters during his impeachment trial in 1999.,2018-08-24 23:09:10,the-new-york-times,"Sex, Lies and Presidents",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/opinion/impeachment-trump-clinton.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/24/opinion/24Stephens-01/24Stephens-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by Trumpâs defenders are reading from the Clinton playbook.  By Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist Over the years Iâve periodically been reminded of the many ways in which Bill Clintonâs presidency debased our civic culture. This week the reminders have been especially pointed. First we had the presidentâs lawyer Rudy Giuliani on NBC on Sunday, explaining to Chuck Todd that âtruth isnât truthâ â an invitation, perhaps, to parse the meaning of âisnâtâ just as Clinton once parsed the meaning of the word âis.â  Next came the publication of a scathing 1998 memo from Brett Kavanaugh, written when the Supreme Court nominee was a young lawyer working for the independent counsel Ken Starr. âThe president has disgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles,â Kavanaugh wrote, calling it âcallous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle.â Then there was Michael Cohenâs guilty plea for criminal violations of campaign-finance laws. This was soon followed by the usual casuistry from Donald Trump and his defenders explaining why the offense, as it related to the president, was legally trivial; or that the economy would collapse in the event of impeachment; or that Trumpâs critics were mentally deranged; or that the president was entitled to the sort of deference due to kings. And as ever, the president continued to lie to the American people, while acting as if the outrage he elicits is merely evidence of how unfairly heâs treated.  It was all vintage Bill: deploying minions to lie about illicit sex (and twist the meaning of words); abusing the powers of the presidency to trash the reputations of others; converting his character flaws into a national convulsion. Clinton did all this, and so has Trump. What the former pioneered, the latter has simply taken to the next level.  Thanks to the #MeToo movement, thereâs been a long-delayed reconsideration among liberals about their past defense of (or relative indifference to) Clintonâs sexual predations. Monica Lewinsky and Juanita Broaddrick, once targets of left-wing snickering and contempt, have at last received a measure of respect as victims and survivors. But the reconsideration isnât complete. On Wednesday, I noted that Republicans who demanded Clintonâs impeachment 20 years ago â because he had corrupted the moral fiber of the country and the legal fabric of the state â are hypocritical in refusing to apply the same logic to Trump. By the same token, liberals now calling for Trumpâs impeachment ought to rethink the excuses so many of them made for Clinton 20 years ago. That it was âjust sex.â Or that âlying about sexâ doesnât rise to the level of an impeachable offense (even if itâs lying about sex under oath). Or that âcharacter doesnât matterâ so long as the administration produces peace and prosperity. Or that the motivating animus of the presidentâs critics is reason enough to dismiss the criticism. These excuses were toxic not because they had no merit, but because they sidestepped the core of the issue: that the survival and ennoblement of democracy depend on holding people in high office to higher, not lower, standards. Clintonâs supposedly âsmallâ lie about sex (like Trumpâs âsmallâ violation of campaign finance laws) was not so small coming from the one person uniquely entrusted to uphold and enforce the law. It sent a signal that lying would be politically acceptable and legally tolerated. Clintonâs lawyerly prevarications helped create the truth-optional standard by which the Trump presidency operates. The claim by Clintonâs defenders that his job performance immunized him from impeachment sowed the seed for Trumpâs remark, in an interview with Fox News this week, that âI donât know how you can impeach somebody who has done a great job.â Then, too, the Clinton machineâs relentless efforts to delegitimize the independent counsel by claiming Starr had gone far beyond his original remit to investigate the Whitewater case mirror the Trump machineâs attacks on Robert Mueller today. Yet what Starr did then is what Mueller and other prosecutors are doing now: uncovering wrongdoing where they find it. That Trumpâs hush money to two women has nothing to do with Russia makes the wrongdoing no less contemptible, illegal â and, because itâs about the president, impeachable. Because the Clinton impeachment saga is still relatively recent, itâs been depressing â and instructive â to watch the two sides in that drama conveniently adopt the otherâs former rationale for their own partisan convenience. (Lindsey Graham, this means you.) But anyone who now calls for Trump to be judged severely should acknowledge that we would have been in a better place today if Clinton hadnât been so fervently defended back then. Among other things, it might have dissuaded other sexual predators and congenital liars from running for high office. We can still get it right. Some intellectual consistency would go a long way.

By Anand Giridharadas Mr. Giridharadas is the author of âWinners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.â âChange the worldâ has long been the cry of the oppressed. But in recent years world-changing has been co-opted by the rich and the powerful. âChange the world. Improve lives. Invent something new,â McKinsey & Companyâs recruiting materials say. âSit back, relax, and change the world,â tweets the World Economic Forum, host of the Davos conference. âLetâs raise the capital that builds the things that change the world,â a Morgan Stanley ad says. Walmart, recruiting a software engineer, seeks an âeagerness to change the world.â Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook says, âThe best thing to do now, if you want to change the world, is to start a company.â At first, you think: Rich people making a difference â so generous! Until you consider that America might not be in the fix itâs in had we not fallen for the kind of change these winners have been selling: fake change. Fake change isnât evil; itâs milquetoast. It is change the powerful can tolerate. Itâs the shoes or socks or tote bag you bought which promised to change the world. Itâs that one awesome charter school â not equally funded public schools for all. It is Lean In Circles to empower women â not universal preschool. It is impact investing â not the closing of the carried-interest loophole.  Of course, world-changing initiatives funded by the winners of market capitalism do heal the sick, enrich the poor and save lives. But even as they give back, American elites generally seek to maintain the system that causes many of the problems they try to fix â and their helpfulness is part of how they pull it off. Thus their do-gooding is an accomplice to greater, if more invisible, harm.  What their âchangeâ leaves undisturbed is our winners-take-all economy, which siphons the gains from progress upward. The average pretax income of Americaâs top 1 percent has more than tripled since 1980, and that of the top 0.001 percent has risen more than sevenfold, even as the average income of the bottom half of Americans stagnated around $16,000, adjusted for inflation, according to a paper by the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.  American elites are monopolizing progress, and monopolies can be broken. Aggressive policies to protect workers, redistribute income, and make education and health affordable would bring real change. But such measures could also prove expensive for the winners. Which gives them a strong interest in convincing the public that they can help out within the system that so benefits the winners. After all, if the Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter and his co-author Mark R. Kramer are right that âbusinesses acting as business, not as charitable donors, are the most powerful force for addressing the pressing issues we face,â we shouldnât rein in business, should we? This is how the winners benefit from their own kindness: It lets them redefine change, and defang it. Consider David Rubenstein, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. Heâs a billionaire who practices what he calls âpatriotic philanthropy.â For example, when a 2011 earthquake damaged the Washington Monument and Congress funded only half of the $15 million repair, Mr. Rubenstein paid the rest. âThe government doesnât have the resources it used to have,â he explained, adding that âprivate citizens now need to pitch in.â That pitching-in seems generous â until you learn that he is one of the reasons the government is strapped. He and his colleagues have long used their influence to protect the carried-interest loophole, which is enormously beneficial to people in the private equity field. Closing the loophole could give the government $180 billion over 10 years, enough to fix that monument thousands of times over. Mr. Rubensteinâs image could be of a man fleecing America. Do-gooding gives him a useful makeover as a patriot who interviews former presidents onstage and lectures on the 13th Amendment. Walmart has long been accused of underpaying workers. Americans for Tax Fairness, an advocacy group, famously accused the company of costing taxpayers billions of dollars a year because it âpays its employees so little that many of them rely on food stamps, health care and other taxpayer-funded programs.â Walmart denies this criticism, citing the jobs it creates and the taxes it pays. When a column critical of Walmart ran in this newspaper some years ago, David Tovar, a Walmart spokesman, published a red-penned edit of the piece on a company blog. Beside a paragraph about how cutthroat business practices had earned the heirs of the Walton family at least $150 billion in wealth, Mr. Tovar wrote: âPossible addition: Largest corporate foundation in America. Gives more than $1 billion in cash and in kind donations each year.â Mr. Tovar wasnât denying the $150 billion in wealth, or that more of it could have been paid as wages. Rather, he seemed to suggest that charity made up for these facts. A few years ago, some entrepreneurs in Oakland, Calif., founded a company called Even. Its initial plan was to help stabilize the highly volatile incomes of working-class Americans â with an app. For a few dollars a week, it would squirrel away your money when you were flush and give you a boost when you were short. âIf you want to feel like you have a safety net for the first time in your life, Even is the answer,â the company proclaimed. The rub against such an idea isnât just that itâs a drop in the bucket. Itâs also that it dilutes our idea of change. It casts an app and a safety net as the same. Fake change, and what it allows to fester, paved the road for President Trump. He tapped into a feeling that the American system was rigged and that establishment elites were in it for themselves. Then, darkly, he deflected that anger onto the most vulnerable Americans. And having benefited from the hollowness of fake change, he became it â a rich man who styles himself as the ablest protector of the underdogs, who pretends that his interests have nothing to do with the changes he seeks. President Trump is what we get when we trust the rich to fix what they are complicit in breaking. In 2016, Mr. Trump and many of the world-changing elite leaders I am writing about were, for the most part, on opposite sides. Yet those elites and the president have one thing in common: a belief that the world should be changed by them, for the rest of us, not by us. They doubt the American creed of self-government. A successful society is a progress machine, turning innovations and fortuitous developments into shared advancement. Americaâs machine is broken. Innovations fly at us, but progress eludes us. A thousand world-changing initiatives wonât change that. Instead, we must reform the basic systems that allow people to live decently â the systems that decide what kind of school children attend, whether politicians listen to donors or citizens, whether or not people can tend to their ailments, whether they are paid enough, and with sufficient reliability, to make plans and raise kids. There are a significant number of winners who recognize their role in propping up a bad system. They might be convinced that solving problems for all, at the root, will mean higher taxes, smaller profits and fewer homes. Changing the world asks more than giving back. It also takes giving something up. Anand Giridharadas is the author, most recently, of the forthcoming âWinners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,â from which this essay is adapted.

And Facebook, YouTube and others found new influence campaigns originating from Russia and Iran.",2018-08-24 13:04:24,the-new-york-times,The Week in Tech: Democracy Under Siege,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/technology/week-in-tech-democracy-siege.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/25/business/25technewsletter/25technewsletter-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by Bits By Natasha Singer Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the weekâs news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hello, everyone. Iâm Natasha Singer, your data privacy correspondent. I devote most of my waking hours to delving into the consequences of digital technologies for society and democracy. I even spent my summer vacation teaching a tech-innovation ethics course for high schoolers attending the School of The New York Times, our precollege program. So it was quite something for me just trying to keep up with all the developments of the week. To recap: Microsoft said Monday that it had found and shut down fraudulent sites that were imitating those of two conservative American think tanks that promote democracy. The phony sites, which were created by hackers linked to a Russian military intelligence unit, indicated that the Kremlin was widening its attacks beyond deceiving voters, my colleagues David E. Sanger and Sheera Frenkel wrote. Then on Tuesday, Facebook said it had identified and purged 652 fraudulent accounts, pages and groups that were trying to spread disinformation. This time the campaigns were aimed at tricking people not just in the United States, but also in Britain, Latin America and the Middle East. And in addition to Russia, there was a new misinformation culprit on Facebookâs radar: Iran. My colleagues Kate Conger and Sheera reported that Facebook had been tipped off to the Iranian fraud by FireEye, a cybersecurity firm. In a riveting article, they described how cybersecurity companies are expanding their focus from trying to thwart more traditional hacking of peopleâs accounts to policing social media networks for pernicious influence campaigns. On Wednesday, Alex Stamos, Facebookâs former security chief, also weighed in with a post on the Lawfare blog calling on the American government to step up its cybersecurity efforts and curb foreign election meddling. âAmericaâs adversaries,â he wrote, âbelieve that it is still both safe and effective to attack U.S. democracy using American technologies and the freedoms we cherish.â This is the argument that Facebook has made all along: that âbad actors,â as Facebookâs chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, termed them, have weaponized our well-intentioned technologies against us. But Facebook and other social networks are inherently designed for virality. And that has enabled domestic political campaigns â not just foreign evildoers â to use Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation with astonishing scale and speed. Consider Vote Leave, the campaign to persuade voters in Britain to leave the European Union in 2016. That campaign spent $2 million on Facebook ads that were seen millions of times, helping it to win the referendum. Some of the campaignâs ads seemed clearly designed to foster xenophobia, according to the Facebook ads recently released by the British Parliament. Other messages â like  one claiming that Turkey was joining the European Union, posted on Twitter by Carole Cadwalladr of The Guardian as an example of fear-mongering â were patently false. From where I sit, Facebookâs trying to weed out foreign election meddling â without remaking the underlying infrastructure that enables influence campaigns in the first place â seems akin to trying to quell an Ebola epidemic by handing out Kleenex. Or, as my colleague Adam Satariano wrote of his interview with a former British national security official, David Balson: âHe said Facebook had to find more sustainable solutions to fighting misinformation than suspending accounts, and argued that many groups would continue their work, but under new names. Each new disclosure, Mr. Balson said, made him wonder what other campaigns were being waged on the social network.â In the weekâs other tech news: â¢ In an opinion piece titled âTrump Knows Digital Ads Work. Why Donât Democrats?â Kendall Collins, the former chief marketing officer of Salesforce, warned Democrats that they were failing to use digital tools to reach and sway voters. âAnyone skilled in marketing,â Mr. Collins wrote, âknows the precision, targeting and cost-effectiveness of online strategies to reach buyers, influencers and, in this case, voters.â â¢ A new study that analyzed every anti-refugee attack over a two-year period in Germany found that higher-than-average use of Facebook in a town correlated with more attacks on refugees. My colleagues Amanda Taub and Max Fisher traveled to German towns to investigate. â¢ Google took the moral high ground on freedom of expression online when it pulled its search engine out of China in 2010 after four years of trying to operate a censored version there. But now Google may be changing its mind â about China as well as its own reputation, my colleague Farhad Manjoo wrote. The company has been testing a censored version of its search engine for the Chinese market, Farhad said, and deploying it would threaten Googleâs self-image as a virtuous place to work. â¢ In this zinger critique  in Real Life magazine, Frank Pasquale, a technology law professor, examined how tech industry influence is skewing priorities in artificial intelligence research and ethics. âEnergy that could be put into better public transit systems is instead diverted to perfect the coding of self-driving cars,â he wrote. âAnti-surveillance activism transmogrifies into proposals to improve facial recognition systems to better recognize all faces.â â¢ And lastly: Universities around the United States are collaborating on the creation of a new academic discipline, called âpublic interest technology.â In a piece in Wired, a Harvard Law professor, Susan Crawford, described how the new field will include âdesigning public policy and laws with an awareness of how technology actually works, as well as ensuring that technology is being used to serve public values of fairness and equity.â I admit Iâm biased since this overlaps with what I taught the high school students, but Iâm rooting for it.

145,MAGGIE ASTOR,"The abuse already common in many women’s everyday lives can be amplified in political campaigns, especially if the candidate is also a member of a minority group.",2018-08-24 09:00:23,the-new-york-times,"For Female Candidates, Harassment and Threats Come Every Day",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/politics/women-harassment-elections.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/10/us/politics/00WOMENSAFETY2/00WOMENSAFETY2-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by The abuse already common in many womenâs everyday lives can be amplified in political campaigns, especially if the candidate is also a member of a minority group. By Maggie Astor Four days before the 2016 congressional primary in her Northern California district, Erin Schrode woke up to tens of thousands of messages. They were everywhere: in her email, on her cellphone, on her Facebook and her Twitter and her Instagram.  âAll would laugh with glee as they gang raped her and then bashed her bagel eating brains in,â one said. âItâd be amusing to see her take twenty or so for 8 or 10 hours,â another said, again suggesting gang-rape. It has been two years since Ms. Schrode, now 27, lost her Democratic primary and moved on. But the abuse â a toxic sludge of online trolling steeped in misogyny and anti-Semitism that also included photoshopped images of her face stretched into a Nazi lampshade and references to âpreheating the ovensâ â never stopped. âShe needs to stop moving her hands around like a crackhead,â said one tweet this year. âAnother feminaziâs plans foiled!â said another. The 2018 election cycle has brought a surge of female candidates. A record number of women ran or are running for the Senate, the House and governorships, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Many more are running for state legislatures and local offices. And in the process, they are finding that harassment and threats, already common for women, can be amplified in political races â especially if the candidate is a member of a minority group. Last year, sexist and anti-Semitic abuse helped drive Kim Weaver, an Iowa Democrat, out of her race against Representative Steve King. Someone crept onto her property overnight and put up a âfor saleâ sign. The neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer published an article (no longer available) titled, as Ms. Weaver recalled it, âMeet the Whore Whoâs Running Against Steve King,â increasing what was already an onslaught of threats. An acquaintance in the German government even called to warn her about a threatening conversation on an extremist message board, and to ask if she had personal security. âIâm normally a pretty brave person, but when you feel like youâre in a fishbowl and you donât know who it is thatâs throwing rocks at you, itâs disconcerting,â Ms. Weaver, 53, said. âYou donât know if itâs somebody sitting in his motherâs basement in Florida or if itâs a gun-happy white supremacist who hates you who lives a block away.â When she withdrew from the race, Mr. King suggested she had made up the threats. âI wanted #KimWeaver IN the race â not out,â he tweeted. âDemocrats drove her out of the race â not Râs. Death threats likely didnât happen but a fabrication.â No independent organization appears to formally track incidents of harassment, and the Democratic and Republican National Committees did not respond to emails asking whether they did. But several groups that work with candidates said they routinely provided personal safety training.  Emily Ellsworth, 31, a Utah Republican, said that when she was seeking party delegatesâ support to get on the ballot for the State Senate this year, a male delegate cornered her at multiple candidate meet-and-greets and messaged her around a dozen times on Facebook. Only after she deactivated her account did he stop.  The messages were not sexually explicit, she said, but made her feel that âhe really wanted to push a more personal relationship and had a hard time accepting the boundaries I had set.â Morgan Zegers, 21, a Republican running for State Assembly in upstate New York, said she had been called a âG.O.P. Stepford wifeâ and often had to delete vulgar comments on her Facebook page. Lauren Underwood, 31, a Democratic House candidate in Illinois, recalled that when she was visiting a supporter, a local Republican stopped by and was affronted when he learned that Ms. Underwood was challenging his friend in Congress.  âHe threw his shoulders back and stood at his largest and leaned into me, as if he was going to launch at me for having the audacity to run for office,â Ms. Underwood said, adding that her supporter came to her defense. Harassment is not new for women in politics, or anywhere else â and men face it too, especially if they are African-American or Jewish. But for women, the harassment is ubiquitous and frequently sexualized, and it has come to the fore this election cycle, partly because so many women are running and partly because more of them are discussing their experiences. Attendees at WomenWin â a forum in June for Democratic women running in Texas, which included a personal safety session led by the police chief of a local university â said they had found a sense of camaraderie in doing so. âBeing in the room with all of those women that are having those same concerns as me made me feel so much saner,â said Samantha Carrillo Fields, 31, a candidate for the Texas House, referring not only to safety but also to other forms of misogyny on the campaign trail. âO.K., so this is real. What Iâm feeling is real. It was really nice having that validation.â In a 2017 video by the Womenâs Media Center, elected officials â including seasoned politicians like Representatives Katherine M. Clark, 55, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 66, Republican of Florida â described their experiences as part of a campaign called #NameItChangeIt, which encourages women to speak out about harassment. And women are more willing to do so than they were even a few years ago. When Rebecca Thompson, a Democrat, ran for the Michigan House in 2014, strangers followed her home from events and drove slowly, repeatedly, past her house. At one point, someone broke into her car. By the end of the campaign, she said, she was sleeping at her partnerâs house because she was afraid to be in her own. âI felt unsafe throughout the entire campaign,â Ms. Thompson, 35, said. âIt almost seemed like psychological warfare, like they were trying to psych me out. It kept me on edge all the time, because I just didnât know where I could go, anywhere in the city, without feeling like I was being followed.â But she was not comfortable speaking out then. âI told myself I had to just suck it up â thereâs no crying in baseball; thereâs no crying in politics,â she said. âHad those things happened now, I do feel like I would have been empowered to speak up about them.â Yet even still, some candidates interviewed said initially that they had not been harassed â but then, when given examples like menacing social media messages, said yes, they had experienced those things. Just as many have observed in the #MeToo movement that a certain level of misogyny is so expected as to feel unremarkable, these candidates said they saw the messages as par for the course.  âIt becomes so normalized, the types of things that people say,â said Mya Whitaker, 27, a Democrat running for City Council in Oakland, Calif. âBeing a black woman and existing, in some cases, is enough to piss people off.â A different kind of normalization happens at the other end of the spectrum, where the harassment is so vicious and constant that it overwhelms the ability to react. As an independent video game developer in 2014, Brianna Wu was the subject of abuse during GamerGate, when women involved in gaming were targeted for harassment.  Now a Democrat running for Congress in Massachusetts, Ms. Wu, 41, said death and rape threats came so routinely that she had ceased to feel much in response. Even when people threw objects through her window. Even when they vandalized her husbandâs car. Even when they emailed paparazzi-like photos of her in her own home. âI often look at it and Iâm like: âI know I should be feeling something right now. I know I should be feeling scared or angry or stressed.â And itâs at a point where I canât feel anything anymore,â Ms. Wu said. âItâs almost like fear is a muscle that is so overtaxed, it can just do nothing else in my body.â Many said it was a point of principle not to be intimidated into silence. Others said their political ideals were simply more important.  âFor good reason, thereâs never any shortage of telling stories about women being harassed on the campaign trail,â Ms. Wu said. âBut I cannot communicate to you strongly enough: Over all, this job is fun. This job is exhausting, but this job is amazing.â Repeatedly, she and others urged prospective candidates not to be deterred. Ms. Zegers said that was why she deleted sexist Facebook comments. âA lot of women pay attention to my page,â she said. âItâs important to me that we show a good dialogue about the issues and we donât scare women away from running.â And some cast the harassment as a hurdle they simply had to overcome if they wanted to change the systems that fuel it. The government is still composed mainly of men who have never experienced sexual harassment, while âfar too many women experience these things,â Ms. Underwood said.  âI think thatâs part of the opportunity in running for progress,â she said. âItâs an opportunity to fix this and stop it from happening in the future.â  Maggie Astor is a political reporter based in New York.

Sign up to get it by email. Hereâs where to find all our Australia and New Zealand coverage. ______ If there was a moment that summed up the feral nature of Australian politics, it must have been when the House of Representatives voted to adjourn Thursday so that the challenge to Malcolm Turnbullâs leadership could work its way out. I was in Parliament House, and the debate made me think of the look our pup gave me when I caught her chewing my favorite books from college. She seemed ashamed, but would she really change? Democracy these days doesnât have much more self-control than that little mutt. Australia is part of a larger trend. In country after country, leaders elected to act on our behalf are encouraging or being threatened by venal instincts and dark urges. Of course, the dysfunction on display in Canberra (hereâs our story on that) is not new. In fact, many sociologists and political scientists will tell you, the unraveling here and elsewhere has been generations in the making. For decades, the ranks of people who run for office in Australia, the United States and in many other âmatureâ democracies have narrowed. Parties have become less representative of the people. Technology has moved faster and with more menace than our public institutions, and at the same time media has become more agenda-driven, more divisive â and more threatened by disruption. The elected leaders who are supposed to be dealing with all of this, in simple terms, are not. Thatâs why the adjournment is worth dwelling on. A handful of politicians stopped working on issues affecting the country for a contest to decide the countryâs direction through a backroom deal unrelated to voter demands or an actual election. The polis got rolled. Is it any wonder that growing numbers of voters in Australia (and itâs not just here) are falling out of love with democracy? And remember, dark humor on social media notwithstanding, there may be long-lasting effects to political failures like the ones weâre seeing. To break up with politics or rage against the machine â these are fast becoming more popular options. The Trump presidency is one result. Many Americans told pollsters they were just so done with the status quo that they bet on a risky unknown. Australiaâs lack of a climate and energy policy is another consequence, as I wrote this week in a story that analyzed why this country is both especially vulnerable to climate change and so unable to address it. But there are more knock-on effects likely â problems that will go unsolved and opportunities missed because of time and effort spent on squabbling. What are the issues that you see government, in Australia or wherever you live, failing to deal with in this moment of distraction? What is being lost because of representative democracyâs hour (era?) of discontent? Share your views in the comments, by emailing nytaustralia@nytimes.com, or in our NYT Australia Facebook group. Now for our stories of the week, and donât worry, itâs not all darkness and despair! ______ While Australians lament the revolving door of their prime ministerâs office, our columnist Bret Stephens bemoans the near-impossibility of budging President Trump â even after he was implicated in criminal acts tied to his lawyer and money paid to keep accusers quiet. ______ From the world of science: Researchers discovered an extraordinary 90,000-year-old fossil in a Siberian cave that suggests the prehistoric world was filled with âhybridâ humans. The owner of this ancient bone fragment had parents from two branches of ancient humans, each lineage separated by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. If these humans could get along, why canât ... Well, you get the idea. ______ Bloody noses, fractured cheekbones and concussions â welcome to Botaoshi, a chaotic Japanese sport that fuses rugby, sumo and martial arts. Many schools have abandoned it (for obvious reasons) but the tradition of âtopple the poleâ persists. You have to watch the video. It makes Rugby League look like a gentle frolic among daisies. ______ â¢ After the first leadership spill of the week, I tried to explore a question the world was asking: Why is climate change so hard for Australian politics?  â¢ You may have missed this among all the Canberra drama this week â Australia has barred Chinese technology giant Huawei from building a 5G network due to cyberespionage concerns.

147,DAISUKE WAKABAYASHI,"The accounts were linked to the state broadcaster, the company said. The news followed similar moves by Facebook and Twitter.",2018-08-23 19:33:48,the-new-york-times,Google Deletes 39 YouTube Channels Linked to Iranian Influence Operation,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/technology/google-youtube-iranian-influence.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,"Advertisement Supported by By Daisuke Wakabayashi SAN FRANCISCO â Two days after Facebook revealed far-reaching Iranian and Russian disinformation campaigns on its social network, Google said Thursday that it had removed 39 YouTube channels linked to the Iranian state broadcaster. Google, which owns YouTube, said in a blog post that it had determined the 39 YouTube channels were linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. It discovered those accounts working off a tip from the cybersecurity firm FireEye about a handful of suspicious Google accounts. Google terminated those accounts, along with six blogs on its Blogger service and 13 Google+ accounts, for running an influence campaign starting as early as January 2017 while disguising its connection to Iran, said Kent Walker, Googleâs senior vice president of global affairs. Google said those accounts had shared âEnglish-language political content in the U.S.,â but it did not provide detail on what types of videos or content. Google revealed the new influence campaigns taking place through its products after Facebook and Twitter announced that they had deleted similar accounts. It is another indication of the growing efforts by state-sponsored actors to use the social media platforms of American companies for politically motivated purposes. While YouTube is the most popular online video platform, with nearly two billion visitors every month, it has managed to avoid the scrutiny heaped upon Facebook for its involvement in spreading misinformation by foreigners. In part, that is because sharing content to other users across its network is not as easy. Googleâs attempts to build a social network to rival Facebook have largely flopped, so fake Google+ accounts reach a limited audience â making it unpopular among both users and foreign manipulators. Google said Tuesday that it suspended one account linked to an Iranian influence campaign. Google said that ârelevant videosâ on the 39 now-deleted YouTube channels had 13,466 total views in the United States â a relatively small number for YouTube. It did not define what constituted a relevant video. Those YouTube channels were terminated over the last few weeks, said Rob Shilkin, a Google spokesman. Google said it had used forensic evidence, such as common internet protocol addresses and website domain information, to conclude that the misinformation campaign was a coordinated attack from Iranâs state broadcaster. âThis finding is consistent with internet activity weâve warned about in recent years from Iran,â Mr. Walker wrote. He added that Google had warned its users about email âphishingâ attempts and security attacks from Iran. A report published by FireEye regarding an Iranian influence campaign aimed at audiences in the United States, Britain, Latin America and the Middle East provided a few examples of YouTube accounts that were trying to advance Iranâs interests. One of those channels was called Liberty Front Press â the account that Google said it had deleted earlier in the week â featuring videos with titles like âRudy Giuliani: Mueller probe now illegitimateâ and âNew C.I.A. chief followed the law, served the country.â Facebook said Tuesday that it had deleted 652 accounts, many of them with Iranian ties. A number of those accounts had been sharing content from Liberty Front Press. In October, Google said it had deleted 18 accounts with links to the Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, that uploaded English-language political content. The channels had uploaded more than 1,100 videos spanning 43 hours. Google said Thursday that it had detected and removed an additional 42 channels from âI.R.A.-related actorsâ since last year. Those channels had 58 English-language political videos, which had accumulated fewer than 1,800 views. Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka. Interested in All Things Tech?

Mr. Thompson, a writer and producer, had never organized an event for a candidate before. Usually, he found politics distasteful. âFolks who know me know that Iâm not exactly a political person,â Mr. Thompson told the crowd of roughly 150 people gathered on the Bowery Hotelâs rooftop for the Aug. 1 event. But if Ms. Nixon is to have any chance of defeating Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the Democratic primary on Sept. 13 â as her campaign insists she does, despite poll after poll in which she trails him by gaping margins â it will be because voters like Mr. Thompson became political people. âPolls are not capturing who the new electorate is,â Ms. Nixon said. âWe have a younger, more progressive, more diverse electorate. Those are the people that are going to turn out for me.â To reach that electorate, Ms. Nixon has spoken at places like the Bowery Hotel fund-raiser, which the campaign billed as an event for âyoung creatives.â She courted support at a South Asian street fair in Jackson Heights, Queens, even though Asians rank near the bottom of ethnic groups in terms of voter turnout. She joined a round-table discussion with the Muslim Democratic Club of New York City, which accused Mr. Cuomo of never visiting a mosque as governor. She met with disability rights advocates, one of whom, Colleen Flanagan, the director of Disability Action for America, said their community had typically seen âzero inclusion, and actually exclusion from political campaigns.â L. Joy Williams, a senior adviser to the campaign, described the approach as seeking out the voters that most campaigns left âon the table.â âWeâve gotten people who say, âNo one has ever knocked on my door for a campaign,ââ Ms. Williams said. âItâs really engaging those pockets all across the state that exist, engaging them because no one has ever engaged them in a real discussion.â Dismissing the polls in favor of anecdotes about âenergyâ and âexcitementâ may seem like at best an excuse and at worst a delusion for a candidate who is 30 points behind. Ms. Nixon herself has acknowledged her path to victory is narrow. But there are reasons to not completely discount her approach. Before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stunned Representative Joseph Crowley in a near-landslide in June, Mr. Crowleyâs internal polling showed him winning by 36 points. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has also emphasized her campaignâs focus on traditionally disengaged voters. Much of the campaignâs attempts to woo disengaged voters has unfolded digitally. The campaign has blasted registered Democrats with text messages and recruited longtime Instagram followers for canvassing shifts. Ms. Nixonâs campaign page has run more than twice as many Facebook advertisements as Mr. Cuomoâs has since May, according to the social media siteâs political advertisements archive, although the governorâs team said those numbers did not account for how many people actually saw each post. Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, has lavished $5 million on television advertisements in the last month alone â more than twice the total amount of money Ms. Nixon has raised overall. âYou donât approach them by putting up TV ads on âJeopardy,ââ Christine Marinoni, Ms. Nixonâs wife, said of the Nixon campaignâs target voters. Ms. Marinoni, a former education organizer, has played a key role in shaping the campaignâs outreach efforts. âTheyâre online 24-7, and theyâre on in a very specific way, and you have to be smart about how to find them.â At the Bowery Hotel event, when Jumaane D. Williams, Ms. Nixonâs chosen candidate for lieutenant governor, asked the crowd â mostly millennials, many nonwhite â if any had received a call from Siena, the college that conducted several of the recent polls, no one raised a hand. Few seemed to understand what or who Siena was. But there is also reason to be skeptical of the campaignâs optimism. While Ms. Nixonâs campaign, with its potent blend of celebrity and âblue waveâ rhetoric, has attracted an unusual amount of attention for a rookie candidacy, much of that attention may not translate into ballots. Ms. Nixonâs campaign has boasted of a record number of individual contributions, but nearly half of her donors do not live in New York State, according to campaign finance filings. One attendee at the Bowery Hotel said Ms. Nixon had helped inspire her to pay more attention to politics, but noted that she was a Canadian citizen. One of the eventâs hosts, Shariffa Ali, said she had just received her artistâs visa as an immigrant from Kenya. Other candidates around the country have cited Ms. Ocasio-Cortezâs win as a blueprint for their own campaigns, but few have matched her success, despite also promising to engage new voters. And the progressive blocs that Ms. Nixonâs campaign has declared will drive her to victory are not united in their support. After the national progressive group Indivisible endorsed Ms. Nixon, several local branches issued an open letter of dissent: In their Facebook groups, members worried about Ms. Nixonâs lack of governing experience. Prominent womenâs and gay rights groups have backed Mr. Cuomo. The New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America endorsed Ms. Nixon, but not before dozens of members signed onto a blog post urging against the decision, raising concerns about her socialist bona fides. The groupâs Albany chapter chose not to issue an endorsement, in part because members thought Ms. Nixon had not spoken enough about upstate. âYouâve got to fish where the fish are,â said Peter Warren, acting chairman of the Albany chapter, of Ms. Nixonâs perceived focus on voter-dense New York City. But as a result, he said, âthe interest was not red-hotâ in issuing an endorsement. The criticism that Ms. Nixon has focused too much on city dwellers is a common one, albeit one her team dismissed, citing visits to Syracuse to discuss immigration policy and to Hoosick Falls on environmental issues. Ms. Nixon may actually find an unexpectedly warm reception upstate. In the 2014 Democratic primary for governor, Zephyr Teachout, who also ran to the left of Mr. Cuomo, won many upstate counties; in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in almost every county outside of New York City. Ms. Nixon may also benefit from voters who are not so much pro-Nixon as anti-Cuomo, as the governorâs gun control policies have made him deeply unpopular in rural areas, including among Democrats. Although Ms. Nixon largely shares Mr. Cuomoâs views on gun control and has called for further restrictions, the Siena polls have consistently shown her with more support upstate than downstate. That diverse amalgam of New Yorkers â those tired of Mr. Cuomo, those who have never heard from Mr. Cuomo, those thrilled about Ms. Nixon â is who Ms. Nixonâs campaign is relying on next month. âTo a certain extent, the larger conversation on who the typical voter is for the campaign, is sort of an outdated model,â Ms. Williams said. But no matter the mold of voter, first they will have to turn out. Ms. Ali, one of the hosts of the Bowery hotel fund-raiser, acknowledged that one event might not be enough to drive her friends to the polls. âI think there were some people who were there that night who were like, âHm, O.K., Iâm here for Shariffa. Iâm here to support my friend. And it also happens to be a Cynthia Nixon event,ââ she said. But even if they did not end up voting for Ms. Nixon â as Ms. Ali, here on an artistâs visa, would not be able to do â she was excited about the potential to start a political conversation. âLike many of my peers, Iâd been sort of apathetic in the sense that I actually have no sway,â Ms. Ali said. âNow that I know this is possible, and I do have some kind of influence, I would like to try and see how many more young people I can encourage to get involved.â Follow Vivian Wang on Twitter: @vwang3     Advertisement",0.037,0.87,0.093,0.9971
149,KATE CONGER and SHEERA FRENKEL,The cybersecurity company has shifted its attention to detecting disinformation and uncovering social media campaigns intended to influence politics.,2018-08-23 09:00:09,the-new-york-times,How FireEye Helped Facebook Spot a Disinformation Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/technology/fireeye-facebook-disinformation.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/23/business/23FIREEYE01/23FIREEYE01-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by By Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel SAN FRANCISCO â FireEye, a cybersecurity company that has been involved in a number of prominent investigations, including the 2016 attack on the Democratic National Committee, alerted Facebook in July that it had a problem. Security analysts at the company noticed a cluster of inauthentic accounts and pages on Facebook that were sharing content from a site called Liberty Front Press. It looked like a news site, but most of its content was stolen from outlets like Politico and CNN. The small amount of original material was written in choppy English. FireEyeâs tip eventually led Facebook to remove 652 fake accounts and pages. And Liberty Front Press, the common thread among much of that sham activity, was linked to state media in Iran, Facebook said on Tuesday. Facebookâs latest purge of disinformation from its platforms highlighted the key role that cybersecurity outfits are playing in policing the pages of giant social media platforms. For all of their wealth and well-staffed security teams, companies like Facebook often rely on outside firms and researchers for their expertise. The discovery of the disinformation campaign also represented a shift in the bad behavior that independent security companies are on the lookout for. Long in the business of discovering and fending off hacking attempts and all sorts of malware, security companies have expanded their focus to the disinformation campaigns that have plagued Facebook and other social media for the past few years. Founded in 2004 in Milpitas, Calif., FireEye has a work force of about 3,000 people, a fraction of Facebookâs. But it employs security analysts with particular skills, including employees who are fluent in English, Arabic, Russian, French and Italian, helping them to identify and track misinformation around the world. Lee Foster, the manager of FireEyeâs information operations analysis team, described in an interview with The New York Times how his company spotted the Iranian disinformation campaign. He declined to say whether his research into the Iranian campaign was on behalf of a particular client because FireEye has a policy against naming who it is working with. âIt started with a single social media account or a small set of accounts that were pushing this political-themed content that didnât necessarily seem in line with the personas that the accounts had adopted,â said Mr. Foster. Many of the fake accounts, which sprawled across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit, shared content from Liberty Front Press. Over two months, Mr. Foster and a small group of analysts mapped the connections between the accounts and unearthed more of them. The evidence pointed toward Iran. A website for Liberty Front Press was initially registered to an email linked to ads for web designers in Tehran before being switched to a registrant purportedly based in San Jose, Calif. The web designer email had also been used to register another news site. That site, in turn, was associated with a number of email addresses linked to even more inauthentic news sites. Digging deeper, FireEye found that many of the Twitter accounts sharing Liberty Front Press content were linked to Iranian phone numbers, although the profiles claimed to be operating in the United States. Stepping from fake news site to news site and from Twitter to Facebook, FireEye pieced together a campaign that tried to influence audiences in the Middle East, as well as in the United States, Britain and Latin America. The analysts were careful to collect data without being noticed. âI have to be conscious about tipping off the operators of this,â Mr. Foster said. âI want to make sure Iâve got everything, so we donât deal with one small component of the threat and we find out thereâs this whole other cluster of it.â Iranâs cyber capabilities have grown in recent years and Iranian hackers have been blamed for a number of significant attacks. Earlier this year,  federal law enforcement officials said nine Iranians were behind intrusions at American government agencies, universities and private companies. Attributing attacks to Iran has been tricky. Security experts who have studied Iranian hackers said many take part in attacks, or disinformation campaigns, while they are still in college. They are often recruited for government work, but may also float in and out of government-backed contracts. Those loose affiliations make it difficult to pinpoint which attacks are directed by Iranian authorities. FireEyeâs information set off Facebookâs own investigation, which uncovered three other Iranian disinformation efforts and another that appeared to originate in Russia. One of the Iranian campaigns Facebook discovered dabbled in a mix of misinformation and more traditional hacking, Facebookâs head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, wrote in a blog post. âThey typically posed as news organizations and didnât reveal their true identity,â he said. âThey also engaged in traditional cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to hack peopleâs accounts and spread malware, which we had seen before and disrupted.â The Russian pages discovered by Facebook were unrelated to FireEyeâs research. Facebook said the accounts were linked to people that law enforcement in the United States had identified as Russian military intelligence. Unlike other fake pages that have been attributed to Russians over the last year, those accounts posted content focused on politics in Syria and Ukraine. FireEyeâs information operations analysis team was formed in 2016, when hacked emails from several political figures were beginning to appear on the site DCLeaks. âAll through that period, we were tracking the Russian effort to influence U.S. elections,â Mr. Foster said. âObviously, social media is a very important kind of medium by which these campaigns are undertaken.â Mr. Foster had been tracking influence campaigns long before they became a major narrative in American politics. He previously worked at iSight Partners, a cyberintelligence firm acquired by FireEye in January 2016, where he tracked so-called hacktivist groups like Anonymous. An attack on Sonyâs computer network by North Korean hackers in 2014 put cybersecurity companies on notice that they had to pay more attention to information warfare. The Sony intrusion was destructive to technical systems, âbut there was more to it than that,â Mr. Foster said. âIt was about conveying a message and trying to influence an audience.â In time, âwe realized there was a bigger kind of potential threat there that we need to address,â he added. The Sony attack was also a game changer for governments and other major companies, said Graham Brookie, the director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, which has analyzed misinformation on Facebook. Thousands of embarrassing emails between Sony executives were dumped online. The hackers also stole employeesâ personal information, including Social Security numbers, and wiped Sonyâs servers. The incident prompted officials in the United States to establish protocols for sharing information about cybersecurity threats and influence operations, Mr. Brookie said. But information sharing still seems to have its limits. Unlike Facebook, Twitter did not receive advance notice from FireEye about the fake Twitter profiles the security company had uncovered. Several of them were still live Tuesday night, hours after Facebookâs announcement. Twitter has since suspended 284 accounts based on the information revealed by Facebook and FireEye, the company said in a tweet. As internet outlets struggle to keep up with influence campaigns, Mr. Foster believes complex disinformation schemes will become more common. âWhat this is great for demonstrating is, it really doesnât matter what the political goals or ideological goals are, these techniques are seen as an attractive way to try to achieve them,â Mr. Foster said.

150,GAIL COLLINS,President Trump seen on a video camera viewfinder at the White House last year.,2018-08-22 23:47:39,the-new-york-times,If All This Was Just a Movie …,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/opinion/trump-investigation.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/opinion/22collins/22collins-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by The White House needs a rewrite. By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist Dear Charlotte and Fred: Hereâs our first memo on your script. The team was excited when we learned you were working on a dystopian drama in which a hack reality TV star gets elected president. Crazy plotline! Weâre very interested, but it needs a lot of work. No audience is going to buy the current version. In one five-minute scene youâve got the presidentâs big campaign guy getting convicted of a jillion different financial crimes, while at the same time the presidentâs old lawyer-fixer is admitting that the leader of the free world told him to use hush money to pay off former sex partners. We love scandals, but this is just too, too over the top.  Also, while we understand youâre going for laughs, weâre pretty sure there is no such thing as a python-skin coat. We canât buy the scene where the president goes to a rally right after all these stories break and heâs got the crowd yelling, âDrain the swamp!â This is the same time youâve got his first two congressional supporters hit by corruption indictments. I know itâs supposed to be irony, but itâs teetering on insanity.  However, we donât want you to drop the congressmen completely. We liked the detail about one orchestrating an insider trade at the White House picnic. And having the other use campaign funds to get a plane ticket for his pet rabbit was a nice touch. Would you think about making it a fuzzy puppy? Then when everybody gets off the plane the puppy could try to lick the president and our hero/villain would recoil. Nothing audiences like better than hating a man who hates dogs. The cast For the lead, weâre wondering if we could talk Liam Neeson into gaining 50 or 60 quick pounds for the part. And maybe a younger Ray Liotta type for the sleazy fixer.  Weâre not buying your current version of the presidentâs other lawyer. Heâs supposed to be a big hero from 9/11 and yet every one of his lines screams âincompetent great-uncle who gets drunk at Thanksgiving.â Youâve at minimum got to give him a different background, like fixing parking tickets. If we can work that out, weâre thinking maybe this is a job for Danny DeVito. The cheery Republican House leaders who ignore everything thatâs going on donât have a big part, but we think itâd be a terrific acting opportunity for the Backstreet Boys. As to the women â we like the stripper. (Reese Witherspoon? Jennifer Aniston?) When she gets paid off to keep quiet about having sex with the about-to-be president, can you give her some special phrase we could feature in the promos? Like âKazowie, Mr. Candidate!â Or âReal leaders use condoms.â Weâre a little concerned youâve made all the lead characters so repulsive that people arenât going to want to go see the film. Mandy has a good suggestion â take a second look at the wife. Right now sheâs way too wooden, and nobody will believe that pair has had sex since Dick Cheney was in power. How about making her a former federal prosecutor who gave up the chance to be attorney general to stand by her man? Is he grateful â or ticked off that she didnât take the job and shield him from investigators? Not a plot twist weâve ever seen before. Foreign affairs Weâre looking for serious international sales, so definitely letâs take this guy to a big meeting with leaders overseas. Maybe a little bit of action when he runs over the head of the European Union in his golf cart. However, nobody here likes the whole Russian subplot. It just doesnât make sense. Youâve got a lead character whoâs in trouble for that girlfriend payoff plot, and for having a whole pile of crooks in his administration. (How many characters, by the way, can get indicted before the credibility fizzles?) And then you have this other whole huge subplot about colluding with the Russians to fix the election. Sorry, any president who had all these messes at once would be out the door in five minutes. Another problem with the first lady: You gave her an immigrant background and a heavy accent. So far, so good. (This is the point where we start fantasizing Meryl Streep.) But youâve also got your lead railing all the time about stopping immigration. Does that make sense? Just donât believe youâre going to get anybody to buy that package. Finally This is an important note from Larry: At the peak of the action, our main man is six feet deep in investigations and he goes out to give a speech to his supporters. In which he keeps reminding them that he won the Electoral College. Now our audience is going to hear that and realize this is a president who didnât win the popular vote.  Larry thinks you should drop that detail and let him win the popular vote. Otherwise, heâs so compromised from the get-go that people will start walking out with the opening credits.

151,Farhad Manjoo,Facebook showed it was proactive against online threats when it revealed new global influence campaigns this week. But being proactive is far from finding a solution.,2018-08-22 23:38:24,the-new-york-times,"Can Facebook, or Anybody, Solve the Internet’s Misinformation Problem?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/technology/facebook-internet-misinformation.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/23/business/23facebook/23facebook-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by State of the Art By Farhad Manjoo In theory, Facebookâs announcement on Tuesday that it had discovered and shut down a wide-ranging Iranian misinformation campaign should make you feel better. The social network was slow to recognize such campaigns as threats before the 2016 presidential election, and it surely deserves some credit for what Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, described as the companyâs shift from âreactive to proactive detectionâ of coordinated propaganda operations. But it was not just Iran, and not just Facebook. YouTube also said that it had removed content linked to the Iranian campaign. So did Twitter. And Facebook said that it had also removed pages stemming from a Russian propaganda operation that was unrelated to the Iranian campaign. And thereâs more: Microsoft announced this week that it had discovered a Russian hacking campaign aimed at conservative think tanks in the United States. And on Wednesday there was news that hackers had this week tried to penetrate the Democratic National Committeeâs voter database. All that in three days. (And Facebook took down another influence campaign last month that was of uncertain origin, but might have been operated by Russians.) Feeling better yet? Yeah, me neither. These drip-by-drip revelations inspire something like the opposite of confidence. Find one cockroach in the kitchen and you might feel better for having caught the sucker. Find another, and then another, and pretty soon you start to wonder if you should burn your house down. And these revelations of mischief underscore the novelty of the threats we are dealing with â and how unprepared we might be to handle them. Some of these disclosures are about actual criminal activity. But others, like the Iranian campaign, describe a more fuzzy kind of misbehavior, one that is not obviously illegal, and whose tactics amount to something that lots of people do everyday: Lying on the internet. Given the gray area some of these activities occupy, figuring out what to make of each revelation â how to assess its potential impact and our collective capacity to respond to it â is going to be the next great task of digital society. And the task is far bigger than any of us realize now. âThe work you see now from Facebook, Microsoft and others to be more proactive is a trend that is positive â itâs part of the solution, and I would want to see that trend continue,â said Graham Brookie, director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, a think tank that has been working with Facebook on election-security issues. But Mr. Brookie added: âIs this a solution? No, definitely not.â A solution, he said, would involve a society-wide reckoning with the problem of the vulnerabilities that the internet has uncovered in democratic society. A solution would involve the federal government taking the lead in such an effort, which is not really happening at the moment. A solution would also involve citizens becoming far more vigilant about what they see online, how they respond to it, and the effect it has on their political lives. And even with all that, we may not really get an actual solution. Instead, the best we might hope for is something like an ongoing cat-and-mouse game between good and bad actors online: a fight that never ends, but whose damage we can at least hope to reduce. Thatâs the long game. The short game is rather more depressing. Consider the most pressing question: How confident should you be that the coming midterm elections will be safe from hacking and propaganda operations online? The most likely answer: Nobody knows for sure, but probably not very confident. Facebook and other tech companies are stepping up their efforts to police their sites before the midterms. But some of the threats they have spotted so far have little to do with the election. The Iranian operation, for example, has been going on for years, and to judge by some of the content posted by these Facebook pages, was not aimed squarely at American elections, but instead American policy. In a call with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that Facebook has been making progress on keeping elections safe, having learned from several races around the world since 2016. âThere was the French election, the German election, the Alabama special election, the Mexican election â and in each of these elections, our systems have been able to find a lot of fake accounts that were attempting potentially to do bad things on the system,â he said. Each time the company finds something, Mr. Zuckerberg added, âWe get better at identifying this kind of activity up front and putting barriers in place to those who would try to abuse these systems.â His words are somewhat reassuring, but only in that they feel like the bare minimum that a company like Facebook should do. Alex Stamos, who until recently was Facebookâs chief security officer, has a dimmer view. In an article published on Wednesday on Lawfare, a news site that covers national security, Mr. Stamos wrote that the string of attacks revealed by Facebook, Microsoft and others were evidence that âAmericaâs adversaries believe that it is still both safe and effective to attack U.S. democracy using American technologies and the freedoms we cherish.â The governmentâs failure to address these threats have left the United States âunprepared to protect the 2018 elections,â Mr. Stamos said. He outlined a set of legislative, regulatory and law enforcement steps Americans might take to secure their digital house. If we move fast, he said, we might be able to salvage 2020.

152,BRET STEPHENS,"Donald Trump arrives for a Make America Great Again rally at the Civic Center in Charleston, W.Va., on Tuesday.",2018-08-22 22:39:34,the-new-york-times,Donald Trump’s High Crimes and Misdemeanors,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/opinion/donald-trump-cohen-impeachment.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/opinion/22stephens-01/merlin_142634196_a4748982-2779-4e9a-83c0-4e6de8ae5b34-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by The principled case for impeachment is clear. Whatâs missing is the courage. By Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist For all of my opposition to Donald Trump, I have long been skeptical of the political wisdom or evidentiary basis of efforts to impeach him.  My reasons: First, being a terrible president and a wretched person are not impeachable offenses. Second, Robert Muellerâs investigation has so far produced evidence that can be interpreted as obstruction of justice, but not as clear proof. Third, impeachment in the House would be unlikely to translate into conviction in the Senate, even if Democrats win both chambers in the fall. Fourth, impeachment without conviction could strengthen Trump politically, much as it did for Bill Clinton after his own 1998 impeachment. And, like it or not, Trump remains popular with tens of millions of Americans. To overturn the results of an election for anything less than unambiguous evidence of criminal behavior is a danger to democracy itself.  At least that was my view until this week. Michael Cohenâs guilty plea changes this. The Constitutionâs standard for impeachment is âTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.â The standard is now met. Trumpâs longtime fixer acknowledged in court on Tuesday that he violated campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women âin coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.â That means Trump. That means that, as a candidate, Trump is credibly alleged to have purposefully conspired with Cohen to commit criminal acts. That means the duo did so âfor purposes of influencing [an] election for Federal office,â which is the legal definition of a campaign contribution. It also means that, as president, Trump allegedly sought to conceal the arrangement by failing to note in his 2017 financial disclosure forms his reimbursements to Cohen. The president most likely continues to lie to the American people about the nature and purpose of those payments. The Trumpian rebuttal to these charges is that Cohen is a sleazy lawyer and proven liar. And that the most prominent attempt to prosecute a political figure for violating campaign-finance laws â involving former Democratic senator and 2004 vice-presidential candidate John Edwards â failed in court. And that campaign-finance violations donât rise to the level of impeachable offenses, anyway. But if Cohenâs lies as Trumpâs lawyer are one thing, lying under oath to a federal judge is quite another. Cohenâs sentencing isnât until December, when heâs expected to be sent to prison for up to five years. If heâs being untruthful, that leaves plenty of time for any deceits to come to light. Ask yourself: Does he look like a guy eager to have his sentence doubled? As for the Edwards standard, the case failed because prosecutors could not prove that the former North Carolina senator received campaign donations from benefactors to influence an election, rather than simply cover up an embarrassing affair. In Trumpâs case, there is little doubt about the purpose of the payment to Stormy Daniels: To prevent disclosure of their alleged liaison, less than a month before the election and barely two weeks after the Access Hollywood tape came to light. To suggest that this doesnât amount to a felonious act also doesnât pass the smell test. The president is now, in effect, an unindicted co-conspirator on charges already prosecuted by the government as a criminal matter against Cohen. Why should a lighter standard apply to Trump, since heâs the one at whose direction Cohen claims to have carried out the payments?  That question should especially engage those conservatives who demanded Clintonâs impeachment (as I did). Take South Carolinaâs Lindsey Graham, one of the House managers overseeing the case against the 42nd president. âTwenty-five years ago,â he said that December, âa Democratic-controlled judiciary committee, with a minority of Republicans, reported articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon. Why? Nixon cheated â he cheated the electoral system by concealing efforts of a political break-in, and his people thought the other side deserved to be cheated. They thought his enemies deserved to be mistreated. Ladies and gentlemen, they were wrong.â  He continued: âToday, Republicans, with a small handful of Democrats, will vote to impeach President Clinton. Why? Because we believe he committed crimes resulting in cheating our legal system. We believe he lied under oath numerous times, that he tampered with evidence, that he conspired to present false testimony to a court of law. We believe he assaulted our legal system in every way. Let it be said that any president who cheats our institutions shall be impeached.â The emphases here are mine. To conservatives reading this column, ask yourselves the following questions:  If breaking the law (by lying under oath) to conceal an affair was impeachable, why is breaking the law (by violating campaign-finance laws) to conceal an affair not impeachable?  If âcheating the electoral systemâ (by means of a burglary) was impeachable, why is cheating the electoral system (by means of illicit hush money) not impeachable?  If cheating âour institutionsâ (by means of an âassaultâ in âevery wayâ on the legal system) is impeachable, why is cheating those institutions (by means of nonstop presidential mendacity and relentless attacks on the Justice Department and the F.B.I.) not impeachable?  Pragmatists will rejoin that thereâs no sense in advocating impeachment when the G.O.P. controls Congress. Iâm sorry that so many congressional Republicans have lost their sense of moral principle and institutional self-respect, but thatâs a reason to seek Democratic victories in the fall. The Constitution matters more than a tax cut. What the Constitution demands is the impeachment and removal from office of this lawless president.

It originated from an Iranian-backed group aimed at Britain, in what the company said was the first known instance of a foreign influence campaign aimed at people outside the United States. Facebook has spent the past two years trying to block foreign propaganda in the United States. But its disclosure of hundreds of fake accounts and pages, including the one tied to the Iranian-backed group, revealed that the foreign manipulation of elections through Facebook extends across the globe. Tactics used by Russia-linked groups ahead of the 2016 presidential election are being applied in Britain, the Middle East and Latin America. Europe, where Facebook has more users than in the United States, is particularly worried. The companyâs announcement exacerbated concerns that the region will be a regular target of foreign propaganda efforts â including ahead of next yearâs European Parliament elections, which will help set the policy direction in Brussels for the next five years. The discovery immediately added momentum in Europe to pass new laws to clamp down on social media platforms, including rules to remove terrorist content and to restrict how voters are targeted with political messages online. Vera Jourova, a European commissioner who has been involved in writing new election regulations for the entire region, said, âWe need to do more to protect our elections and tackle the online challenges to elections head on.â In a statement, Ms. Jourova promised election rules would be introduced in the next few months, ahead of the European Parliament elections in May. âFacebook can be used for evil, thatâs a fact,â said Claude Moraes, a British member of the European Parliament who leads a panel that has been investigating Facebookâs role in elections. âFacebook can be used to manipulate elections, thatâs a fact.â Russia has long viewed the European Union as an adversary, and influencing the parliamentary campaigns is a way to diminish its clout, said Mr. Moraes, who organized a recent series of hearings that featured testimony from Facebook executives. âI have no doubt that Facebook will be a critical componentâ of Russiaâs efforts to undermine the European Union, he said. Facebook said on Tuesday it had removed the 652 fake accounts, pages and groups. The posts from those accounts played up emotional political issues, including immigration, the conflict between Israel and Palestine, and Britainâs vote to leave the European Union. Facebook shared only a limited number of examples of suspended posts, many of which were the kinds of internet memes that are common in newsfeeds on the platform, using humor to play on controversial political topics. But unlike those targeted at Americans, the posts made public on Tuesday have a more international bent, including some written in Arabic and Farsi. And in identifying Iran for the first time, Facebook acknowledged that countries other than Russia, which the company said was also behind some of the newly uncovered accounts, are now trying to manipulate its platform to intensify political divisions abroad. âThe real concern here is this new evidence suggests that other regimes are learning from what Russia achieved,â said Philip Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University studying the use of social media to spread misinformation. âThe Iranian government saw what impact Russia had with its communications campaign and they are sinking resources into this as well.â Over all, the posts show an attempt to exacerbate divisions that already exist. One featured a cartoon supporting Boris Johnson, a former member of Prime Minister Theresa Mayâs cabinet, to replace her as prime minister, while another backed Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britainâs opposition Labour Party. (A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn declined to comment.) While the reaction in Britain was immediate and vocal, officials in the Middle East and Latin America, where similar propaganda efforts were made, were initially silent. In the Middle East, Facebook is a key source of news and is frequently used as a platform for political discussions, but citizens are also more accustomed to navigating state-backed propaganda, potentially muting the impact of information campaigns in the region. Facebookâs announcement made few waves in Israel or the Palestinian territories, where the social media system is already filled with nationalistic and political messaging. Some even downplayed the significance of the companyâs moves, describing it as possibly part of an in-house public relations exercise. âFacebook removes suspicious accounts all the time,â said Gabi Siboni, director of the cyber security program at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. He said Facebook was playing a âgame of cat and mouse.â As the company changes its policies, or adjusts its algorithm, outside groups adapt. Many of the posts deleted by Facebook supported pro-Iran causes, or attacked Israel and promoted the Palestinian territories. Others included language critical of President Trump. David Balson, a former official at Britainâs Government Communications Headquarters, the countryâs equivalent of the National Security Agency, said Facebookâs global platform made it an enticing place for government-backed groups to influence public debate. In effect, it offered a cheap and fast way to spread a message. âIn the Cold War, you needed to set up radio stations or print newspapers,â said Mr. Balson, who is now director of intelligence at Ripjar, a data analytics company. âNow all you need is a laptop and a credit card.â He said Facebook had to find more sustainable solutions to fighting misinformation than suspending accounts, and argued that many groups would continue their work, but under new names. Each new disclosure, Mr. Balson said, made him wonder what other campaigns were being waged on the social network. âItâs just the tip of the iceberg of whatâs out there,â he said.

154,KENDALL COLLINS,The party’s campaigns are ignoring obvious opportunities to engage with voters.,2018-08-22 14:45:03,the-new-york-times,Trump Knows Digital Ads Work. Why Don’t Democrats?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/opinion/trump-democrats-republicans-digital-ads.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/opinion/22kendallcollins/22kendallcollins-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by The partyâs campaigns are ignoring obvious opportunities to engage with voters.  By Kendall Collins Mr. Collins is a board member at Tech for Campaigns. President Trump may not be up for re-election until 2020, but since May 31, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee â his re-election campaign âÂ has spent $629,500 on advertising on Google platforms alone, making it the top spender on political ads on Google platforms. Thatâs nearly $200,000 more than the No. 2 spender, One Nation, a right-wing organization focused on influencing Senate elections. This information comes from Google, which just increased transparency into political ad spending on its platforms. Anyone skilled in marketing knows the precision, targeting and cost-effectiveness of online strategies to reach buyers, influencers and, in this case, voters. When I was the chief marketing officer of Salesforce a few years ago, the industry standard was to allocate 25 percent to 30 percent of marketing budget to digital channels, and that allocation has increased since then across all industries. Last year, for the first time, global ad spending on digital channels eclipsed traditional TV spending. By 2020, digital is expected to account for over 50 percent of all ad spending. And then there are the Democrats: The average nonpresidential Democratic campaign spends only 10 percent to 15 percent of its budget on digital channels while pouring 60 percent to 70 percent of its budget into television ads and direct mail. That is shocking, especially because people now spend an average of 5.9 hours online every single day, with 3.3 of those hours on mobile devices. So why are Democratic campaigns ignoring such obvious opportunities to engage with voters? Iâm honestly not sure; perhaps old habits are hard to break. But outdated models arenât going to win in this digital world. Unlike the Democrats, Republican candidates and right-wing organizations are prioritizing the right channels. In the average 2016 Senate general election, Republicans outspent Democrats by a three-to-one ratio on YouTube, AdWords and other Google channels. From January to June, during the primaries, this gap was even wider at 20 to one. Itâs even worse for down-ballot, state-level campaigns, which are under-resourced in both manpower and financial support. A typical state legislative campaign might run with an average budget of $150,000 (just 10 percent of the budget of a successful federal House race). With a smaller budget, you need to be intentional and efficient. Why spend money on TV ads, which are often aired beyond your voting district or skipped entirely with DVRs, when you could be utilizing Google AdWords and Facebook ads that can zero in on specific ZIP codes and target voters by segment or even language? Candidates who understand the potential of reaching people through digital channels on a limited budget, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have seen a lot of success. Her campaign commercial, âThe Courage to Change,â cost less than $10,000 to produce and went viral online, garnering over 3.7 million views through her Twitter account.  Other Democrats should take a cue and double down on digital: It empowers them to reach more people with less money, engage in back-and-forth conversations with voters and test what messaging is resonating in real time. It should also prove critical in turning out a younger voting population, which often sits out midterm elections. State-level campaigns are more crucial than ever in 2018. The people who are elected to state office this November will be responsible for redrawing voting district maps after the 2020 census, which can greatly skew the odds in favor of one party or the other and directly affects the election process at both the state and federal levels for the next decade. The Republicans know this: After the election of President Barack Obama, they systematically focused on the states, flipping over 900 seats from Democrat to Republican by his second term. To win those back, it is crucial that the Democrats modernize and implement substantial digital campaign strategies this year. In Silicon Valley, support for Democrats is overwhelming, so how can we be getting beaten so badly at the digital game that we largely created? Iâve done some hand-wringing over the realization that maybe the tech community hadnât been active enough politically. It turns out, I wasnât the only one in Silicon Valley seeking a way to put my skills to good use to fix this catastrophe. In early 2017, three tech entrepreneurs started Tech for Campaigns â I sit on the companyâs board âÂ to begin building and executing digital strategies for nonpresidential candidates. They asked friends and colleagues if theyâd be interested in volunteering their tech skills to these campaigns and within 72 hours had over 700 sign-ups. Since then, the organization has grown to over 7,500 skilled volunteers, completed over 75 projects with campaigns and played a major role in the Virginia 2017 midterms â contributing to nine wins, eight of them flipping seats from red to blue. They have built an impressive infrastructure that can rapidly scale to help hundreds of campaigns this coming November and long into the future. These volunteers are defining and executing digital strategies on campaigns: running email campaigns and paid digital ad programs, creating websites, building software and tools for caucuses and campaigns that save time and serve to amplify great candidates and ideas. It might be the largest force of digital talent that Democrats have assembled anywhere, and it came together in less than one year because so many talented professionals were craving a way to make a difference. Our tech community is full of smart people who have the passion and the optimism to make a change in our electoral process. Itâs time for us to step up and make our own contribution to the thousands of progressive candidates who are running for change. Letâs start winning the digital game that we built before itâs too late. Kendall Collins is the former chief marketing officer of Salesforce and a board member at Tech for Campaigns.

155,Issie Lapowsky,The tech industry lobby has made it clear that they want changes to California's sweeping privacy protections—and they've got plenty of time left to get them made.,2018-08-29 14:27:57,wired,The Fight Over California's Privacy Bill Has Only Just Begun,https://www.wired.com/story/california-privacy-bill-tech-lobbying/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b807fa4385cec3f290b9763/191:100/pass/SiliconValley-578551046.jpg,"In June, privacy advocates celebrated the passage of a historic bill in California that gave residents of that state unprecedented control over how companies use their data. Two months later, the party's over. Lobbying groups and trade associations, including several representing the tech industry, immediately started pushing for a litany of deep changes that they say would make the law easier to implement before it goes into effect in January 2020. But privacy advocates worry that pressure from powerful businesses could end up gutting the law completely. ""This is their job: to try to make this thing absolutely meaningless. Our job is to say no,"" says Alastair MacTaggart, chair of the group Californians for Consumer Privacy, which sponsored a ballot initiative that would have circumvented the legislature and put the California Consumer Privacy Act to a vote in November. Big Tech and other industries lobbied fiercely against the initiative. In June, MacTaggart withdrew it once the bill, known as AB 375, passed. At the most basic level, the law allows California residents to see what data companies collect on them, request that it be deleted, know what companies their data has been sold to, and direct businesses to stop selling that information to third parties. But the task of shaping the specifics is now in the hands of lawmakersâand the special interests they cater to. âThe new sheriffs showed up and drew a gun. Then they put it down and walked away,â Kevin Baker, legislative director of the American Civil Liberties Union in California, says, referring to MacTaggartâs initiative. âNow that theyâve done that, and the initiative threat has gone away, weâre back to politics as usual.â With just three days left in the legislative session, California lawmakers are scrambling to vote on a new bill, called SB-1121. The original bill had been hastily written and passed in an effort to keep MacTaggart's initiative off the ballot. The original goal of SB-1121 was to deal with typos and other small, technical errors, with the hope of introducing more substantive changes in further legislation next year. But over the last few weeks, groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the Internet Association, which represents companies like Google and Facebook, have pushed for significant alterations, even as the tech industry works to develop a federal privacy bill that would, if passed, override California's law. âThe lack of precise and clear definitions in this legislation will make compliance difficult for companies looking to do the right thing,â Robert Callahan, vice president of state government affairs at the Internet Association, said in a statement. âThis could lead to serious and costly consequences for internet businesses in California, which contribute 11.5 percent to the stateâs overall GDP, as well as every other sector of the economy.â In early August, a coalition of nearly 40 organizations, ranging from the banking industry to the film industry to the tech industryâs leading lobbying groups, sent a 20-page letter to the lawmakers behind SB-1121, effectively a wish list of changes. While the suggestions weren't ultimately included in the draft that legislators will vote on this week, they're a clear sign of the battle in store for 2019. 'If these changes are permitted, a business could offer incentives that are unjust or unreasonable.' Mary Stone Ross, Privacy Advocate Among the most significant proposed changes was a reframing of who the law considers a âconsumer."" The bill as written applies to all California residents, a provision that industry groups wrote would be âunworkable and have numerous unintended consequences.â Instead, trade groups wanted the law only to apply to people whose data was collected because they made a purchase from a business, or used that businessâs service. They also proposed making it so that only businesses had the right to identify people as consumers, and not the other way around. Such a change might seem small, but it would substantially narrow the lawâs scope, says Mary Stone Ross, who helped draft the ballot initiative as the former president of Californians for Consumer Privacy. âThis is significant because it [would] not apply to information that a business does not obtain directly from the consumer,â Ross says, like data sold by data brokers or other third parties. Another major change sought to tweak disclosure requirements. Whereas the original bill requires companies to share specific pieces of data, the industry groups prefer to draw the line at ""categories of personal information."" There are other, subtler suggested changes, too, that Ross says would have sweeping implications. The law includes language that would prevent a business from discriminating against people by, say, charging them inordinate fees if they opt out of data collection. But prohibiting blanket discrimination is too broad for the business groups, who want to add a caveat specifying that they may not âunreasonablyâ discriminate. In another section, which discusses offering consumers incentives for the sale of their data, the industry groups also proposed striking the words âunjustâ and âunreasonableâ from a line that reads, âA business shall not use financial incentive practices that are unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious in nature.â âIf these changes are permitted, a business could offer incentives that are unjust or unreasonable,â Ross says. Weakening these non-discrimination provisions, she says, could âturn privacy into a commodity that will disproportionately burden the poor.â On Tuesday night, during an Assembly hearing on the bill, the final sticking point, particularly for the tech giants, was the law's handling of data collected for the purposes of advertising. While the law prohibits users from opting out of advertising altogether, it does allow them to opt out of the sale of their personal information to a third party. But the industry wanted to create an exception for information that's sold for the purposes of targeted advertising, where the users' identities aren't disclosed to that third party. Privacy groups including the ACLU and EFF vehemently opposed the proposal, as did MacTaggart. They argued that such a carve-out would create too big a loophole for businesses and undermine consumers' right to truly know everything businesses had collected on them. ""I was surprised they were this blatant, this early,"" MacTaggart says. ""I expected this attack in 2019, but not in August 2018, two months after we passed the bill in the first place. "" As of Tuesday night, the industry groups failed to get that amendment into the bill. But MacTaggart and others expect to fight this battle all over again next year. It's not that the privacy bill is perfect. The ACLU, for one, criticized the bill's exclusion of a provision in the ballot initiative that would have given people the right to sue companies for violating their data privacy rights. It instead leaves enforcement up to the Attorney General, except in the case of a data breach. In turn, attorney general Xavier Becerra proposed his own list of changes to the law in a letter last week, including the restoration of people's ability to sue. As the bill was being finalized, all sides did agree to some tweaks, like clarifying language that would protect data collected through clinical trials and other health-related information. Another change ensures that information collected by journalists remains safeguarded. And while the Attorney General didn't get everything he asked for, the legislature did agree to provide his office with an additional six months to implement enforcement regulations. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also concedes the law needs more substantive work. The organization wants to change the bill so that consumers would be able to opt into data collection, rather than opt out. The EFF also wants to ensure the law applies not just to businesses that buy and sell data, but data they share freely, sometimes at no cost to either party. That's how some app developers were able to gain access to tons of Facebook userâs friendsâ data for years. 'I was surprised they were this blatant, this early.' Alastair MacTaggart, Californians for Consumer Privacy And yet Lee Tien, senior staff attorney at the EFF, says the business groups' hamfisted efforts to jam so many changes through in a matter of months is counterproductive. ""There will be battles over the definition of consumer and personal information, and weâre prepared to talk seriously about those definitions,"" he says. ""But that can't happen in any kind of responsible, grown-up way, in a short period of time."" For now, all sides at least agree that SB-1121 is effectively a stopgap. The fact that big businesses didn't get their way this time hardly signals a resounding victory for privacy. Next year's legislative session will likely see new bills with even more serious changes proposed by influential industries. ""They've got another chance to succeed, and theyâll be back for sure,"" Baker says. ""One of the reasons why AB 375 passed unanimously is everyone knew thereâd be a cleanup bill, and they had plenty of time to lobby to get their changes through,"" adds Ross, who opposed pulling the ballot initiative in June. Some engaged citizen, of course, could always mount another bid for a ballot initiative, but with the 2018 deadline already passed, that couldn't happen until at least 2020, and it would take millions more dollars to put up another fight. That's left activists like Ross and MacTaggart relatively powerless in the very battle they began. ""I can talk to people and wave my arms around,"" MacTaggart says. ""But the day I signed to give up the petition, Iâm like Cinderella back in a pumpkin."" The only way to be truly secure on Facebook is to delete your account. But that's crazy talk!

156,Brian Barrett,A sentence-by-sentence breakdown of Trump's recent tweets about the search giant reveal why Google is his most convenient target.,2018-08-28 18:59:32,wired,Why Google Is a Perfect Target for Trump,https://www.wired.com/story/trump-google-news-algorithm-target/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b857d591419cf3acdceed2d/191:100/pass/PresidentTrump1024583628.jpg,"A full hour before the sun rose in Washington, DC, Tuesday, President Donald Trump fired off a pair of tweets claiming that Google had âriggedâ search results against conservatives. Like so many Trump grievances, the argument seems steeped less in fact than in a roiling stew of personal animus. But in Google News, the latest subject of his ire, Trump may have found the perfect target. In Trumpâs tweetsâwhich he later deleted, then tweeted again, with no substantive changesâyou can see the outlines of an attack that canât be easily fact-checked or dismissed. Charges of bias against Google will stick, because no algorithm is truly neutral. And while Trumpâs logic is specious, effectively countering it would require acceptance among his base that mainstream news sources like The New York Times are not, actually, the enemy of the people. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1034456281120206848 In truth, thereâs a lot going on with these two tweets. So much so that itâs helpful to break down what Trumpâs claiming, and why, and what he plans to do about it, sentence by sentence: Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. Here, Trump is including not just The New York Times, CNN, and familiar targets under the ""Fake News Media"" umbrella, but every major media outlet other than The Wall Street Journal and The Economist. We know this because his entire argument appears to be based on this recent story in PJ Media, which claims outrageous bias in Google News results against conservative sites, yet counts everything from Reuters and Bloomberg to the Columbia Journalism Review as left-leaning. (Trump not only cites a specific statistic from the PJ media piece, suggesting strongly thatâs his source, but also famously doesnât use a computer. Googling ""Trump News"" is not a lived experience for him.) In a statement, Google rejected Trumpâs premise: âSearch is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.â Google News, if anything, appears to be one of the few places left online that hasnât devolved into microtargeted filter bubbles. In a study published just last month in Computers in Human Behavior, researchers Seth Lewis and Efrat Nechushtai found that Google News recommendations were in fact largely homogeneous, with liberals and conservatives being shown the same links regardless of ideology. In addition, the top five results for news searches came overwhelmingly from a handful of mainstream sources: The New York Times, CNN, Politico, and The Washington Post. âYes, Google News is dominated by mainstream news,â says Lewis, who focuses on emerging media at the University of Oregon. âIf you consider mainstream news to be left-leaning, you will have concerns about the results you get from Google News. Thereâs no question about that.â Itâs that âifâ that Trump is leaning on. If you consider everything left of The Daily Caller biased, youâre going to find bias everywhere you look. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Google doesnât ârigâ its algorithm against conservatives, or against Trump, at least not in the way that he means here. Whether the stories and news it surfaces are âbadâ depends on what happened in the worldâlike, say, close associates pleading guilty to or being convicted of federal crimesâright before you search. A very simple case in point: If you type âTrumpâ or âTrump newsâ right now into Google News, the top results all center around this very tirade.  The fourth result in a recent search in an incognito window, which doesn't factor in search history, came from the reliably conservative Fox News. Is Google News rigged, though? Almost certainly not, but youâd be hard-pressed to prove it. Thatâs because Google search, like Facebookâs News Feed and other platforms, derives its power from an algorithm for which no one outside of the company has any specific insight. âThe ways in which right-wing organizations have been able to manipulate Google and Facebook have actually worked in Donald Trumpâs favor."" Safiya Noble, USC âBlack box algorithms may be kept secret for business and intellectual property reasons, but theyâre vulnerable to conspiracy theories,â says Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. âThereâs no way to know what the algorithm is doing for someone outside of Google or Facebook, or whatever tech company youâre talking about. And in some deeper, fundamental way, some of the machine-learning algorithms, even the people working on them donât fully understand what theyâre doing.â That has very real stakes; a 2015 study showed that the ordering of positive and negative stories in Google search rankings could hold real sway over how people vote. Keeping algorithms closely held does have the benefit of making Googleâs systems harder to game, but it also gives Trump a huge amount of runway to make allegations that arenât easily disproven. Fake CNN is prominent. True enough, at least the prominence part. Lewis and Nechushtai found that CNN occupied a slot in the top five rankings for news stories on Google 12 percent of the time. Only The New York Times had more, hitting 22 percent. But relying on mainstream news outlets rather than the fringes has its own societal benefit. âThe argumentâthat it's bad that Google leads people to find democratic news organizationâis dangerous. What we want is for people to have access to common understandings about whatâs happening in the world, and investigative journalism thatâs vetted and in many ways credible,â says Safiya Noble, professor at the University of Southern California and author of Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism. ""We certainly want people to have access to multiple news outlets, and search engines often do lead us to multiple voices. Itâs just the more powerful voices are often on the first page.â Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Again, it depends on how you define the terms. But this sentence features at least two levels of absurdity. âThe conceptual problem with Trumpâs tweets is the idea that an algorithm is only fair if it returns an equally balanced number of stories favoring one side versus the other,â says Nyhan. âTake that to its logical extreme: Imagine if you searched for âdoes gravity exist,â and Google had to return half of the search results saying âactually it doesnât.â Itâs a preposterous notion, but thatâs the implication of the presidentâs claim here.â The idea that Google and other platforms have shut out conservative voices is also broadly incorrect. âWhat we have found over and over again, for a long time, is that the most conservative and racist and misogynist voices are deeply skilled in optimizing content, and have had more than their fair share of control and representation in search. In fact, it was that phenomenon that led to President Trump getting elected,â adds Noble. âThe ways in which right-wing organizations have been able to manipulate Google and Facebook have actually worked in Donald Trumpâs favor."" Illegal? Algorithms can indeed be found to be in violation of the law, according to Salome Viljoen, a privacy fellow at Harvard Universityâs Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. But that's not what's happening here. If Googleâs algorithms did in some way infringe on free speech, that would only be legally problematic if Google were the US government. âYou have no constitutionally protected free-speech right on Google. Itâs a private platform,â says Viljoen. Similarly, Google would be in legal trouble if its search algorithm were discriminating against a constitutionally protected class, but the 14th Amendment does not cover political conservatives. Lastly, algorithmic bias could be illegal if it somehow caused someone to, say, be turned down for a loan application, notes Viljoen. But since with news results thereâs no information being sold to third partiesâfor example, banks, to continue the hypotheticalâthat concern doesn't apply. So, to answer Trump's question in one word: No. 96% of results on âTrump Newsâ are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. See above. The 96 percent number comes from the PJ Media story, which defines âNational Left-Wing Mediaâ as anything mainstream. Yet a study following the 2016 election actually found the candidate who most benefited from mainstream media bias was Trump, since coverage of Hillary Clinton was found to be overwhelmingly negative, and mainstream outlets paid comparatively little attention to Bernie Sanders. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. This is a new spin on the argument that Twitter was biased against conservatives because it banned several  accounts for abusive behavior. Itâs the behavior part that matters. Or in this case, itâs the thousands of signals that Google uses to determine which sites rise to the top of the rankings. âWhen it comes to a regular Google search, people still might not realize what that represents,â says Lewis. âThereâs preferential attachment for sites that have been around a long time. Sites that have more incoming links are seen as having higher authority. There are certain terms over time where you develop that Google juice, that gives you more salience in the rankings. The same factors that go into Google search go into Google News.â They are controlling what we can & cannot see. Itâs true! Google does control what people see, in a way that deeply impacts societyâespecially marginalized voices. ""Google search results work in favor of people in power, quite frankly,"" says Noble. ""What you are more likely to see are vulnerable communities, racial and ethnic minorities, women and girls, and so forth, who are often much less likely to have influence over the algorithm or over search-engine optimization strategies and so forth in a major search engine like Google."" By appropriating this argument to his own ends, Trump also shifts attention from the very real conversations that should happen around algorithms, corporate responsibility, and representation. ""There are very many real concerns about the influence these companies wield. What's disappointing about Trump's argument is that it forces people who want to defend freedom of the press into a defense of the platforms, which deserve a lot of scrutiny. They do exert a disproportionate influence over the information people see,"" says Nyhan. ""The danger, though, is that they will be bullied into political submission"" by Trump and other aggrieved conservatives. That could take troubling forms; look no further than Facebook cowing to conservative pressure and abandoning oversight of Trending Topics, which let unvetted stories run rampant on the platform leading up to the 2016 election. Google News today shows everyone the same stories, projecting a ground-level truth. The alternative: deeply entrenched echo chambers, the kind that have turned so much of the internet toxic. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed! Itâs not clear what sort of regulation Trump has in mind here. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday that the administration was âtaking a lookâ at the possibilityâbut even the threat has serious implications. ""We should take seriously when political leaders threaten speech and media coverage they donât like,"" says UMich's Nyhan. ""We should worry about not just formal mechanisms of power but informal ones, political leaders bullying companies into their skewing search results or their coverage because of the threat that they'll be attacked by political leaders, or subject to regulation or other types of scrutiny.â Facebook failed that test in 2016. Now it's Google's turn. But with its algorithm locked in a black box, and an opponent who views any media left of Breitbart with suspicion, it's going to be an unwinnable fight. The LAPD is one of a growing number of police departments using algorithms to try to predict crimes before they happen. Proponents of these tools say they provide cops with added tools to keep their cities safe -- but critics argue it's just another form of profiling. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast.

157,Ellen Pao,CEO naiveté is not a credible excuse for letting fake news and harassment flourish on your platform.,2018-08-28 12:09:52,wired,Don’t Pretend Facebook and Twitter’s CEOs Can’t Fix This Mess,https://www.wired.com/story/ellen-pao-facebook-twitter-ceos-can-fix-abuse-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b8493217033850305093989/191:100/pass/JackDorsey-AP_17256391059646-w.jpg,"Itâs not often you hear some of the richest, most powerful men in the world described as naive, but itâs becoming pretty commonplace. Mark Zuckerberg, after a dark period for Facebook, has been called naive more than once. Jack Dorsey, meanwhile, has admitted having to rethink fundamental aspects of Twitter. But I struggle to believe that these brilliant product CEOs, who have created social media services used by millions of people worldwide, are actually naive. Itâs a lot more likely that they simply donât care. I think they donât care about their users and how their platforms work to harm many, and so they donât bother to understand the interactions and amplification that result. Theyâve been trained to not care. The core problem is that these CEOs are actually making totally logical decisions every step of the way. Capitalismâwhich drives the markets, investors, venture capitalists, and board membersâdemands a certain approach to growth and expansion, one that values particular metrics. So social media companies and the leaders who run them are rewarded for focusing on reach and engagement, not for positive impact or for protecting subsets of users from harm. Theyâre rewarded for keeping costs down, which encourages the free-for-all, anything-goes approach misnomered âfree speech.â If they donât need to monitor their platforms, they donât need to come up with real policiesâand avoid paying for all the people and tools required to implement them. Ellen Pao (@ekp) is an Ideas contributor at WIRED. She is founding CEO of Project Include and author of Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change. Previously Pao was CEO of Reddit. But the way investors, companies, and even many users value engagement has a fundamental flaw exposed ruthlessly in the past couple of years. CEOs and VCs donât generally track whether user interactions that fuel a lot of tech platforms are positive or negativeâthey just look at overall metrics around users, views, likes, and shares. Many users, on the other hand, want attention, often regardless of whether the likes and shares are positive or negative; they quickly learn that the more outrageous and angry the tweets and posts get, the bigger the engagement response. Everyoneâs holding hands on the road to hell. In the earliest days, it wasnât always obvious what these platforms were doing and what they would becomeâeven to insiders. But at a certain point, it became clear that money was the driving factor, and dopamine- or rage-induced interactions meant more money. They didnât care about creating a positive experience for usersâwhich would at a minimum require physical and mental safety. Every single one of them knew what was going to happen. And we saw it time and time again. At Reddit, where I was CEO, we saw the dangers of unfettered free speech and engagement addiction. When we allowed linking to stolen naked celebrity photos on Reddit, that was what took over the site and what the site became. People flocked to Reddit to find stolen nude photos, and the commentary was neither enlightening nor humanizingâand invasive in so many ways for the subjects involved. Good conversations were pushed off the site by the overwhelming demands to see nude photos. Social games companies like Zynga admitted that they were hunting the âwhalesââhigh-spending users who could drive financial resultsâand that meant encouraging unhealthy behavior. Weâve already seen Gamergate, the Boston Marathon witch hunt, and Myanmar rioting. Mark Zuckerberg isnât naive: He knew what he was doing. Jack Dorsey knows what having Donald Trump and Infowars on his platform means. These CEOs, and the board members and investors who back them, choose not to know the details. Because they donât want to know. Jack Dorsey knows what having Donald Trump and Infowars on his platform means. We have enough evidence. We know that when harassment happens, you end up with a site that is filled with the loudest, meanest voices and the worst content. We know that it silences voices. We know that the dark corners will take over the entire site. Hereâs what I think we should do. We must use this as our lens the next time a CEO claims ignorance. We must hold them accountable, and we need to stop contributing to their cycles of dangerous behavior. Companies can address harassment without hurting their platforms. Taking down shitty content works, and research supports it. When we took down unauthorized nude photos and revenge porn, nothing bad happened. The site continued to function, and all the other major sites followed. A few months later, we banned the five most harassing subreddits. And we saw right away that if we kept taking down the replacement sites, they would eventually disappear. University researchers who studied the impact of the ban report that it successfully shut down the content and changed bad behavior over time on the siteâwithout making other sites worse. Taking down shitty content works, and research supports it. If youâre a CEO and someone dies because of harassment or false information on your platformâeven if your platform isnât alone in the harassmentâyour company should face some consequences. That could mean civil or criminal court proceedings, depending on the circumstances. Or it could mean advertisers take a stand, or your business takes a hit. Today, I donât see a single CEO or even board member who is willing (or perhaps able) to step up and say: âEnough. Iâm willing to focus on quality and user experience. I am willing to take a hit on quantity to create a real place for meaningful conversation and to end harassment, misinformation, and the goal of engagement at any cost.â We need to fill this vacuum of leadership. Thatâs where todayâs user is stepping in to try to patch the void because, ultimately, companies and their leaders are even more addicted to engagement than they want their users to be. Employees, advertisers, and users are trying to hold them accountable to their policies and values. Vimeo staff forced the company to take down Infowars. At Reddit, staff didnât want to work for a company that was only posting stolen nude photos, and their response helped fuel the change in policies. Many of us have stopped posting new content to Facebook and, more recently, Twitter to protect ourselvesâand because it doesnât feel consistent with our values. I didnât download Twitter on my latest phone, and Facebook hasnât been on my last two phones. And on August 8, I stopped contributing to Twitter altogether. I still need to use Twitter for work, but my personal view is that any content I contribute is promoting white supremacy and harassment. Others are taking a stand, like the #GrabYourWallet, #DeactiDay, and #BlockParty500 movements on Twitter, or the Sleeping Giants campaign to pressure advertisers on Breitbart. It often feels like a game of whack-a-mole; something we canât fix without CEOs making change a priority. CEOs should just forget about hiding behind ânaiveteâ and âfree speech,â and instead remind themselves they can take actions that will meaningfully change the direction of the future. The first step is acknowledging the problem. The second step is learning more about the problem, who is affected, how interactions become engagement, and how to distinguish between positive engagement and negative ones. Youâve solved for increasing engagement; now itâs time to make real, positive interactions a priority. The only way to be truly secure on Facebook is to delete your account. But that's crazy talk! Here's how to lock down your privacy and security and bonus, keep targeted ads at bay. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast. All rights reserved.

158,Louise Matsakis,We're increasingly wary of sharing too much on social media. So why are we still doing it on Venmo?,2018-08-26 11:00:00,wired,Stop Sending Money on Venmo. There Are Better Alternatives,https://www.wired.com/story/venmo-alternatives/,/images/video-fallback/w-fallback-full.png,"Venmo, the popular payment app owned by PayPal, has become the default way millions of Americans settle a check, pay a friend back for coffee, or buy a concert ticket off Craigslist. Writers have argued that Venmoing makes us petty, and that the app has nearly killed cash. Fewer have questioned whether itâs really the best service for exchanging money, or storing sensitive banking information. The app has reigned supreme for over half a decade, but in 2018, there are more secure and easier-to-use payment options worth considering as replacements. Venmoing may be standard, but hereâs why Iâve switched. Most Venmo competitors, like Squareâs Cash app, share the same core feature: You can send money with a few taps and swipes. Venmo is unique in that it has a social networking component. By default, all peer-to-peer Venmo transactionsâaside from the payment amountâare public, to everyone in the world. Venmoâs insistence on mimicking a social networking app isn't just weirdâit can have unnerving consequences. Creepy, right? Venmo does give users the ability to limit who can see transactions both before and after they're sent, but many people donât choose to adjust their privacy settings. When I opened Venmo recently, the first payment on my news feed was from a friend whose concerns about privacy have led him to delete both his Instagram and Facebook accounts. Despite taking drastic steps to limit his digital footprint, I know who he ate sushi with last night, thanks to Venmo. Venmoâs insistence on mimicking a social networking app isn't just weirdâit can have unnerving consequences. In July, privacy advocate and designer Hang Do Thi Duc released Public by Default, a site that taps into Venmoâs API to highlight how much information can be gathered about you from your public activity on the app. She was able to trace the exact spending habits of a couple in California, documenting what stores they shopped at, when they took their dog to the vet, and when they made loan payments. The same month, an engineer created a now-defunct Twitter bot that documented Venmo payments referencing drugs. Three years earlier, two unrelated technologists made a similar site to track supposedly scandalous payments, which is still running. In the past, PayPal has insisted that users can simply change their Venmo settings to opt out of this kind of tracking. But even the Federal Trade Commission has argued that changing your Venmo privacy settings has historically been too onerous. In February, PayPal settled with the regulatory agency over allegations that Venmo âmisled consumers about the extent to which they could keep their transactions private.â (Recently, even PayPal employees have questioned whether all transactions should be public by default, according to a Bloomberg story published earlier this week.) The FTC said Venmo didnât make it clear that users needed to change multiple settings in order to make their transactions truly hidden. The agency said the app also failed to disclose that one party in a transaction could retroactively change the privacy settings the other person set for the exchange. Venmo now includes a privacy tutorial pop-up for all new users, according to a spokesperson for the company. In the same complaint, the FTC also alleged that Venmo, at least until March 2015, âmisrepresented the extent of security it provided to consumer financial accounts,â by claiming that it had âbank-grade security protections.â While Venmo doesnât appear to make such claims on its website anymore, the app isn't a bank, even though we often treat it like one. Venmo won't, for example, typically provide the same level of customer service in the event your money is stolen. Venmo does offer some security protections, like requiring a unique pin be entered to access your account. But again, theyâre not enabled by default. If Venmo were the only cash-transfer app of its kind, then fine. But there are plenty of better options out there. Apple Pay Cash, the iPhone makerâs Venmo-equivalent, requires two-factor authentication on your Apple ID to start making payments. It was also rated the best peer-to-peer payment app by Consumer Reports earlier this month, largely for its robust security protections. One downside: You can only use it to transfer money between Apple devices. If you have an Android device, or simply want a payment app thatâs hardware neutral, Squareâs Cash app works great. The app's interface is sleek and easy to use, and there's no weird newsfeed. Sure, all your friends may be on Venmo, but maybe not for long: Square Cash is quickly growing more popular. The app was downloaded more times than Venmo in July and, as of earlier this week, it ranked higher than Venmo in the Apple App Store in the free finance apps category. For the most part, Square Cash and Venmo share many of the same features. One downside to Square Cash is that it charges a 1.5 percent fee to instantly transfer a payment to your bank account, while Venmo only charges 25 cents. That higher fee can be a pain if you need to move a large amount of money quickly, but neither app charges anything for non-rush bank transfers, which typically occur the next business day. Square Cash also allows you to discover users nearby using Bluetooth, lowering the possibility of sending beer money to the wrong John Smith. If youâd rather not download a new app, both Facebook and Google offer ways to send and receive money through services you may already use, like Gmail and Messenger. Your banking app may also already have the payment transfer service Zelle built into it, which could become more popular than Venmo this year. An additional upside to these services is that you can use many of them from your desktop. Venmo, on the other hand, recently announced plans to disable its web functionality, making it mobile-only. You likely already have several Venmo alternatives waiting for you on your phone. At the very most, youâll need to convince your friends to download Square Cash in order to fully rid yourself of Venmoâs strange news feed. I, for one, already have it installed. The launch of Appleâs iPhone X brought face recognition, animoji, and the notch into the mainstream. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast. All rights reserved.

159,Emily Dreyfuss,"In security news this week, Apple and Facebook beef, Reality Winner gets sentenced, facial recognition at the airport, and more.",2018-08-25 14:43:20,wired,"Reality Winner, Insider Trading, and More Security News This Week",https://www.wired.com/story/delete-onavo-facebook-vpn-app-security-roundup/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b8086a63dca62083fbf4860/191:100/pass/FacebookCreepyApp-831882106.jpg,"The biggest news in America this week struck like two timed missiles minutes apart on Tuesday afternoon. Though they appear at first blush unrelated to Russiaâs hacking of the 2016 US election, they are likely to explode right in the heart of Robert Muellerâs investigation. First. Trumpâs former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to two feloniesâimplicating the president in both crimes in courtâand then Trumpâs former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty of eight criminal charges. Robert Mueller expert Garrett Graff explains what this means for the Russia investigation, and spells out the six biggest questions now facing the administration, Congress, and the American people. WIREDâs latest cover story details the most devastating cyberattack in history. Andy Greenberg spent the better part of a year getting the full story of the NotPetya code, which took down the worldâs cyber infrastructure in 2017. Greenberg reveals previously untold details about the devastation NotPetya caused, particularly at shipping giant Maersk, in breathtaking detail. Of course there was more news in the security world. The Democratic National Committee thought a phishing test was a real attack. Researchers discovered the ultrasonic sound monitors make can reveal whatâs on your screen. We explained how to protect yourself from a SIM swap attack. Facebook and Twitter thwarted suspicious activity coming from Iran, and Microsoft seized six domains owned by Russian hacking group Fancy Bearâboth of which were attempting to influence the midterm elections. With tech companies seemingly on the front lines of defending democracy from foreign aggressors, we wonder, why isnât the government doing more? Should it really be up to Silicon Valley to defend US democracy? Plus, there's more. As always, weâve rounded up all the news we didnât break or cover in depth this week. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. Appleâs been a quest this summer to force all apps in its App Store to conform to stricter privacy rules. Unsurprisingly, Facebookâs so-called security app Onavo failed and was subsequently booted. Onavo is a virtual private network app that lets you access the internet on your phone through a private Facebook server. While that makes it harder for third parties or hackers to spy on your phone activity, it gives Facebook full access to it. Not ideal. And while Facebook removed Onavo from the App Store, if you downloaded it alreadyâor if you have it on Androidâit's still there, logging all your data. You need to delete the app manually. And if youâre still not convinced itâs a bad idea to let Facebook spy on all your phone activity even when it has nothing to do with the social media site, we wrote you this explainer about all Onavoâs problems a few months. Read it, then get deleting. This story is bananas. In possibly the biggest security fraud case in US history, according to law enforcement, stock traders on Wall Street were paying hackers to break into business newswire websites to steal embargoed press releases that would allow the traders to make preemptive stock buys. The Verge this week traced the whole scheme back to three Russian hackers, who were embroiled in a turf war over access to the press release sites. The story is a classic saga of greed, but with a modern twist: with the internet, insider trading becomes a whole new thing. As reporter Isobel Koshiw writes, âTraders no longer need someone inside a company to obtain inside information. Instead, they can turn to hackers, who can take their pick of security weaknesses.â Australia has a lot going for it: weird animals, lots of sun, and great accents. But apparently internet security isnât a strong suit. At least, not in Western Australia, where a recent security audit of government agencies found that more than a quarter of government officials had seriously weak passwords. Five thousand of them has the word âpasswordâ in their password. Luckily, this was revealed by a government-ordered audit, so thereâs time for these officials to process the shame of their poor passwords and come up with something stronger. If they need some tips, they can start here. Only three days after Washingtonâs Dulles Airport switched on its new biometric facial recognition tech, the system caught an imposter trying to enter the US from Brazil on a fake passport. This is the first time this implementation has caught an identity scammer, according to authorities. They said it was likely human passport agents would have allowed the man to enter because he looked much like the picture on the passport. The facial recognition system, however, flagged him. Authorities later found the manâs real ID hidden in his shoe, arrested him, and sent back to Brazil. On Thursday, a US District Court Judge in Georgia sentenced former NSA contractor Reality Winner to 63 months in prison for violating the Federal Espionage Act. Winner had pled guilty earlier this summer to leaking a confidential NSA report on Russian election hacking to the website The Intercept. The Intercept faced criticism after it published an article based on Winnerâs leak, because in the process of reporting it inadvertently clued officials into Winner's identity based on printer marks on the leaked document. If you have no idea what Struts 2 is, you should stop reading, go outside, and enjoy your weekend, hopeful that the people who do know keep reading and update theirs immediately. Threat Post reports that the Apache Software Foundation found a vulnerability in open-source developer framework Struts 2, used for coding in Java, that could be more dangerous than a similar vulnerability that led to the massive Equifax breach last year. âThe vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of untrusted user data in the core of the Struts framework,â Threat Post reports. Apache is urging all developers to update. If you use Struts 2.3, update to 2.3.35. If you use 2.5, update to 2.5.17. Got that? Great. Thanks for updating and keeping us all safe!

160,Issie Lapowsky,"For years, Iran has run its own secret infowar—running a remarkably similar playbook as Russia.",2018-08-24 20:51:46,wired,What We Now Know About Iran's Global Propaganda Campaign,https://www.wired.com/story/iran-global-propaganda-fireeye/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b806e982c80eb32627bf13d/191:100/pass/Iran-1011992634.jpg,"They set up phony news sites with stories ripped from other sources, backing up their state-sponsored agenda. They stole photos for their social media profiles and made up names to catfish unsuspecting victims. They formed an incestuous web of promotion across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, Reddit, and other platforms. They seemed to have a thing for Bernie Sanders. And then they got caught. Yes, that's the story of the infamous Russian trolls who spread divisive content throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season. But it just as easily applies to the recently discovered propaganda network that Facebook and Google have linked to Iran's state media corporation, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. They and Twitter have since deleted hundreds of accounts between them, thanks to a tipoff from vigilant researchers at the cybersecurity firm FireEye. Over the last two months, the FireEye team pulled on what looked to the untrained eye like unrelated threadsâthe phone numbers these accounts used to sign up for Twitter, the emails they used to register domains, the changes to their account names over time. This week, the broader operation unraveled. In a new report published Thursday, FireEye illuminates exactly how this front in the global information wars played out. 'On the Iranian side, I get the sense that it was one-sided. ' Lee Foster, FireEye In a lot of ways, the latest influence campaign followed a playbook similar to the one used by Russian propagandists at the Internet Research Agency during the 2016 election. But there are key differences. The biggest: While the Russian trolls staked out both sides of almost any issue in order to pit Americans against each other, these Iranian accounts primarily supported their own domestic interests. ""The Russian accounts seemed to be designed to sow divisions between groups for the purpose of undermining trust in the democratic process, and creating a distraction within US politics,"" says Lee Foster, manager of information operations analysis at FireEye. ""On the Iranian side, I get the sense that it was one-sided. We didn't see pro- and anti-Palestinian content. We saw anti-Israeli commentary and pro-Palestinian commentary."" In the US, Russians posed as both Trump supporters and Bernie bros, the Iran-linked websites and pages pushed explicitly anti-Trump content, seizing on hashtags like #Resist, #LockHimUp, and #NotMyPresident. Though Facebook found some accounts dating back to 2011, much of the network FireEye discovered seems to have been created in early 2017, after Trump assumed office. The anti-Trump onslaught from Iran stands to reason. As a candidate, Trump campaigned on overturning what he referred to as the ""disastrous"" Iran Deal, which lifted certain global sanctions on the country in exchange for tightened restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. In May of this year, Trump followed through on that promise, heightening fears of escalating cyberattacks from an already active Iran. (In March, the US indicted nine Iranians for cyberattacks on 144 US universities. This week, cybersecurity firm Secureworks published a new report indicating that those attacks are ongoing.) The main node promoting these messages in the United States was called Liberty Front Press, a website that purported to be âcomprised of independent journalists, activists, and anyone who wants to shape the direction of our world toward a better future.â In truth, much of the content was stolen from sites like RawStory, CNN, and Politico. Not only that, but the email address used to register the site appears to be associated with a web designer in Iran. It was also used to register a separate website in the network called Instituto Manquehue, which targeted Latin Americans with positive messages about the Venezuelan and Bolivian president, who have friendly relationships with Iran. FireEye's investigation began with Liberty Front Press and the accounts that heavily pushed its content, and spread from there. ""We looked at who else is pushing content from this site online, and we were able to identify additional clusters of accounts and look at what they are pushing,"" Foster says. ""Repeating the cycle, we end up with this network of these different inauthentic news sites and social media accounts."" In addition to Instituto Manquehue, the analysts found two additional networks masquerading as US news groups (US Journal and Real Progressive Front), two sites purporting to be based in the United Kingdom (The British Left and Critics Chronicle), and a constellation of fake personas promoting their content. Despite their purported origins, these sites repeatedly honed in on news regarding the Middle East, covering topics like the Syrian civil war and Palestinian rights. The phony personas stole pictures from stock photos, news stories, and at least one French actress's headshot. Using open source tools, the researchers found that the Twitter accounts affiliated with these sites and with the coalition of fake personas were registered with phone numbers using Iran's +98 country code. They also appeared to be most active at times that corresponded with the Iranian work week. Much of the content was stolen from sites like RawStory, CNN, and Politico. Unlike the Russian campaign, these interlocking networks don't appear to have targeted any one election or vote. Foster says the analysts also found no evidence of these accounts trying to penetrate existing communities in these countries the way the Russian trolls did. In many cases, the Internet Research Agency accounts and pages reached out to American activists to get them to co-host events or even sign up to teach self-defense classes, anything to engender trust with American voters in order to further manipulate them. The Iran-linked pages, by contrast, appear to have engaged in old-school broadcast-style propaganda, promoting news stories skewed toward Iranian interests. At least, that's how much is known now. Foster acknowledges there's lots more work to do analyzing the content of these accounts and pages. Much of it will have to come from the tech companies themselves. FireEye has no access, for instance, to information about the audiences these pages and accounts amassed and whether they were made up of authentic or inauthentic users. This week, representatives from the tech industry are reportedly gathering in San Francisco to share information about what types of information operations they've uncovered, and how they plan to tackle the problem going forward. In the meantime, Foster says, his team at FireEye will continue to keep watch across all of these platforms for signs of what the big tech companies may have missed. ""Weâll be continuing as if it was any other day,"" Foster says, ""looking for new activity, not just from Iran, but from wherever it may emanate."" Digital avatars and tools like Apple's new Animoji app may forever change the way we communicate. But they're also blurring the line between reality and fantasy. We take a look at how this technology works and what can be done to prevent the spread of manipulated videos in the future. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast. All rights reserved.

161,Louise Matsakis,The social network erroneously turned extra security protections off—after I had *strengthened* my privacy settings.,2018-08-24 18:55:12,wired,An Undiscovered Facebook Bug Made Me Think I Was Hacked,https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-bug-two-factor-hack/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b80511ca7169055c5a9116c/191:100/pass/How%20a%20Facebook%20Bug%20Made%20Me%20Think%20I%20Was%20Hacked%20v2.jpg,"My legs were sticking to the vinyl back seat of a NYC cab when I received the email on a Thursday this July. I was running late to an afternoon dentist appointment, and sending messages on Facebook Messenger. Most of the conversations were for a story I was reporting about a Facebook group for sexual assault survivors, which had been overtaken by abusers. At the time, I was messaging with one of the abusersâwho was using a fake profileâhoping to find out how they weaponized the group for harassment. In the middle of our exchange, I received an email from Facebook, which said, âWe wanted to let you know that your mobile number was removed from your account. Because of this, weâve turned off two-factor authentication on your account to make sure you donât get locked out when using an unrecognized computer or mobile device to log in.â I hadn't removed my phone number; I immediately assumed I had been hacked, especially given the story I was reporting. Like hundreds of millions of people around the world, my Facebook account contains the record of a decade of my life. But in this case, my messages also contained stories of harassment by the same person I believed had breached my account. The message didnât include an easy way to notify Facebook that I hadnât authorized the change, though there was a button informing me I could add a new mobile number if I wished. From the taxi, I called my editor, as well as another colleague, in an effort to contact Facebook as soon as possible. While I paced my dentistâs office and tried to explain the situation to the receptionist, my coworker reset my password from a laptop at work. She checked the âactive sessionsâ on my account, the devices on which I was logged in. She didn't find anything amissâmy Facebook looked normal. At the time, Facebook also could find nothing wrong. I switched from SMS two-factor authentication to one of Facebookâs newer, more secure methods of safeguarding my account, and hoped that everything was OK. Itâs evidence of the implicit trust we all put in Facebook to safeguard our most sensitive communications. As it turns out, it mostly was. This week, Facebook confirmed that I had actually encountered a bug that automatically turned off two-factor authentication when users changed their phone number, or adjusted the privacy settings associated with it. In my case, as part of undergoing a Facebook ""privacy checkup"" before messaging the troll, I had made the number on my account visible only to me. Because of the bug, Facebook thought I was removing my number altogether, and turned SMS two-factor authentication off. Facebook says the issue affected âa very select number of people,â though it did not specify a number. âWe thank Ms. Matsakis for bringing this to our attention. We addressed the issue as soon as we were made aware of it. We continue to encourage people to apply two-factor authentication, and if this security feature is deactivated for any reason, Facebook will notify you of the change,â Pete Voss, Facebookâs security communications manager, said in a statement. He added that these sorts of problems are brought to Facebookâs attention regularly, and you can report your own issue here. As a journalist, I was able to get someone from Facebookâ s communications team on the phone quickly, and she made sure my case was addressed. But the vast majority of Facebook users who experience a security problem arenât able to talk to someone right away. A normal Facebook user in my situation may have also ignored or missed the initial email about two-factor authentication being turned offâleaving their account far less secure than they intended. This is also the second SMS two-factor authentication bug that Facebook has suffered this year. In February, the social network sent unsolicited marketing messages to the phone number users signed up with for two-factor authentication, an issue it later admitted was a mistake. If anything, the incident is fodder for the argument that we should all be moving away from SMS two-factor authentication, for more pressing reasons beyond Facebook bugs. But my stressful dentist appointment in July unearthed more than just a lesson about security hygiene. Itâs evidence of the implicit trust we all put in Facebook to safeguard our most sensitive communications. I immediately took for truth the unlikely scenario that I was hacked, even when all signs pointed to a problem with Facebookâs systems. The platforms we rely on the most are built by humans, which means they'll always make mistakes. The only way to be truly secure on Facebook is to delete your account. But that's crazy talk! Here's how to lock down your privacy and security and bonus, keep targeted ads at bay. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast. All rights reserved.

162,Issie Lapowsky,"A new Chrome extension rates news sites on trustworthiness, with input from experienced reporters.",2018-08-23 13:01:33,wired,"NewsGuard Fights Fake News With Humans, Not Algorithms",https://www.wired.com/story/newsguard-extension-fake-news-trust-score/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7df9d94711c736f78633dc/191:100/pass/newsguard.jpg,"Say you're scrolling through Facebook, see an article that seems a little hinky, and flag it. If Facebook's algorithm has decided you're trustworthy, the report then might go to the social network's third-party fact checkers. If they mark the story as false, Facebook will make sure fewer people see it in the News Feed. For those who see it anyway, Facebook will surface related articles with an alternative viewpoint just below the story. Every major platformâTwitter, YouTube, Reddit, and moreâhas some version of this process. But they all go about it in completely different ways, with every tech company writing its own rules and using black box algorithms to put them into practice. The patchwork nature of promoting trustworthy sources online has had the unintended consequence of seeding fears of bias. That's one reason why a group of journalists and media executives are launching a tool called NewsGuard, a browser plug-in for Chrome and Microsoft Edge that transcends platforms, giving trustworthiness ratings to most of the internet's top-trafficked sites. Those ratings are based on assessments from an actual newsroom of dozens of reporters who comprise NewsGuard's staff. They hail from a range of news organizations, including New York Daily News and GQ. Together, they've spent the last several months scoring thousands of news sites. To vet the sites, they use a checklist of nine criteria that typically denote trustworthiness. Sites that don't clearly label advertising lose points, for example. Sites that have a coherent correction policy gain points. If you install NewsGuard and browse Google, Bing, Facebook, or Twitter, you'll see either a red or green icon next to every news source, a binary indicator of whether it meets NewsGuard's standards. Hover over the icon, and NewsGuard offers a full ""nutrition label,"" with point-by-point descriptions of how it scored the site, and links to the bios of whoever scored them. The tool is designed to maximize transparency, says Steve Brill, NewsGuard's cofounder, best known for founding the cable company Court TV. ""Weâre trying to be the opposite of an algorithm,"" he says. Brill started NewsGuard with Gordon Crovitz, former publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Along with the launch of the plug-in, NewsGuard is announcing partnerships with Microsoft as part of its Defending Democracy Program. The startup has also forged a deal with libraries in at least five states, which plan to install the extension on their own computers and educate members about how to use it at home. âAdding this service on computers used by our patrons continues the long tradition of librarians arming readers with more information about what they are reading,â Stacey Aldrich, the state librarian of Hawaii, said in a statement. 'Weâre trying to be the opposite of an algorithm.' Steve Brill, NewsGuard Brill and Crovitz launched NewsGuard in response to two dueling crises facing journalism: the declining trust in mainstream media, and the proliferation of fake news that masquerades as legitimate. To fend off the threat of heavy-handed regulation, tech companies have unleashed artificially intelligent tools, which in turn have sparked charges of censorship. Recent changes to Facebook's algorithm, for example, led to traffic declines at a range of media outlets. But Republican members of Congress have since seized on the shrinking reach of sites like The Gateway Pundit as evidence that Facebook censors conservatives. Brill and Crovitz view NewsGuard as a sort of compromise. ""We see ourselves as the logical, classic, free market American way to solve the problem of unreliable journalism online,"" Brill says. ""The alternatives out there are either government regulation, which most people should rightly hate, and the second-worst idea, which is: Let's let the platforms continue to say they're working on algorithms to deal with this, which will never work."" NewsGuard's staff of nearly 40 reporters and dozens of freelancers are still working their way through 4,500 websites that they say account for 98 percent of the content shared online. The creators say they're on track to meet that goal by October. Sites can score up to 100 points on the NewsGuard rubric, with certain offenses, like repeatedly publishing stories identified as false, carrying extra weight. Any site that receives less than 60 points gets marked as red. The NewsGuard staff calls all of these organizations to discuss their shortcomings, and to ensure that they've characterized the site fairly. ""Algorithms don't call for comment,"" Brill says, adding that dozens of sites that have already improved their scores by integrating NewsGuard's criteria. Political leaning doesn't come into play; a conservative site like Fox News gets the same green light as a left-leaning one like Think Progress. Similarly, both InfoWars and Daily Kos, which sit on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, scored in the red. NewsGuard's generous threshold does mean that sites can get away with quite a bit and still score a green rating. ""Not all greens are the same,"" Crovitz cautions. That's why NewsGuard publishes its nutrition labels, to help inform users about where a given site might fall short. The Daily Caller, for one, passes NewsGuard's test, despite losing points for deceptive headlines, failing to disclose its financing, and failing to separate news and opinion responsibly. NewsGuard's long list of advisors includes marquee names from the federal government, including former homeland security secretary Tom Ridge, former undersecretary of state for public diplomacy Richard Stengel, and former Central Intelligence Agency director General Michael Hayden. But high-profile names won't alone be enough to convince people that NewsGuard's ratings are the ground truth. ""In a world in which 10 or 15 percent of people think Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States and another 10 or 15 percent probably still think 9/11 was an inside job, obviously not everyone is going to believe it,"" Brill says. ""We think more people will than won't, or at least, more people will be more informed and maybe more hesitant about sharing."" One recent study by Gallup and the Knight Foundation suggests that could be true. Researchers tested NewsGuard's ratings, asking more than 2,000 US adults to rate the accuracy of 12 news articles on a five point scale. Some saw articles with NewsGuard's ratings, some didn't. The researchers found that subjects perceived news sources to be more accurate when they had a green icon attached than a red icon. They were also more likely to trust articles with a green icon than articles that had no icon at all. NewsGuard's leaders hope that the tech companies that already dictate much of the world's information diet will license their nutrition labels in some form. That's one way the company plans to make money. It also licenses these ratings to brands who want to create an advertising white list that prevents their ads from appearing on unsavory sites. Microsoft is sponsoring the tool as part of its recently formed Defending Democracy Program. ""As a NewsGuard partner weâre really interested in seeing how their service helps provide an additional resource of information for people reading news,"" Tom Burt, Microsoft's corporate vice president of customer security and trust, told WIRED in a statement. ""As we see how the technology is adopted in the market weâll also consider other opportunities."" 'More people will be more informed and maybe more hesitant about sharing.' Steve Brill, NewsGuard The NewsGuard team has also had meetings with Facebook, though the social networking giant wouldn't confirm whether it's considering a partnership. It's a lot to ask of a company like Facebook, which has kept its processes secret so it doesn't have to engage in debate about every judgment call. The few times Facebook's secret sauce has been exposed, it backfired. Two years ago, when word got out about how Facebook picked trustworthy news outlets in its Trending Topics section, it kicked off years of accusations of political bias that continue to this day. This year, the company axed Trending Topics altogether. Tech companies are gradually coming around to the idea of working with certain, well-known third parties on content moderation. YouTube, for one, has begun surfacing Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Brittanica content alongside common conspiracy theories about topics like the moon landing. It may take time to convince these same giants, already reluctant to pick favorites, to adopt this still untested methodology. But that shouldn't stop the rest of us from getting a head start. Many fake news peddlers didnât care if Trump won or lost the election. They only wanted to pocket money. But the consequences of what they did shook the world. This is how it happened.

163,Daniel AlarcÓn,More Americans rely on Puerto Rico's grid than on any other public electric utility. How one renegade plant worker led them through the shadows.,2018-08-23 10:00:00,wired,What Happened in the Dark: Puerto Rico's Fight for Power,https://www.wired.com/story/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-recovery/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7ce9636dc9f536620f01cf/191:100/pass/puertorico__67A4202%20(2400).jpg,"More Americans rely on Puerto Rico's grid than on any other public electric utility. How one renegade plant worker led them through the shadows. Several weeks before he would become a folk hero across Puerto Rico, Jorge Bracero slipped in a puddle at San Juanâs central power plant and broke his leg. After a few days in a cast, he began to feel pain so intense he was unable to sleep or eat. When doctors realized he had developed blood clots in his injured limb, they prescribed a six-month regimen of blood thinners and barred him from returning to work for the duration. It was July 2017. So when the first big storms of that hurricane season began bearing down on Puerto Rico, Braceroâa power plant operator with the islandâs public electric power authority, known as Prepaâsat on the sidelines, miserable and frustrated, reliant on a pair of crutches. Bracero is 38 years old and stoutly built, with buzzed hair and a dark beard. He has a sharp, pointed nose and prominent eyebrows that sometimes knit up into twin, back-to-back apostrophes at the middle of his foreheadâespecially when he is concerned. And he was often concerned that fall. When Hurricane Irma hit the island on September 5, Bracero and his wife, Charlot, were among the 1.1 million Puerto Rican customers who lost power. They rode out the storm and its aftermath with relatives who had a generator; Charlot was seven months pregnant with their first child. Bracero slept on a couch, passing his days laid up in the humid late-summer heat, anxious that his wife might go into early labor, and fuming that he couldnât do his part to get the power back on. âI felt useless,â Bracero says. The job that Bracero was desperate to get back to can be brutal on a good day. On any given shift, he and one or two partners are responsible for operating two 15-story-high boilers, along with the 20 burners that heat them to produce steam and the six massive power-generating turbines that turn under the steamâs pressure. Braceroâs role is to tend to the machinery itself, while his partner sits at a console monitoring the plantâs water, oil, temperature, and pressure levels, constantly relaying information to Bracero. The heat is intense, the work exhausting. When he comes home, his clothes go straight to the balcony because they smell so powerfully of sweat and diesel. Why Can't We Fix Puerto Rico's Power Grid? Drones Help Bring Back Electricity in Puerto Rico In Puerto Rico, No Power Means No Telecommunications Since he was unable to pitch in at the plant, Bracero settled instead for defending his colleagues on Facebook, where predictable rounds of invective were being heaped on Prepa for its failure to restore power. Normally, Braceroâs Facebook persona tended toward cheeky political memes, Game of Thrones jokes, and Star Wars references. But now he took to posting photos of Prepa workers doing dangerous things to get the lights back on. One grainy cell phone image showed a lineman balancing on a helicopter skid in midair, stretching his arms out into space to repair wires at the tip of a utility pole. âAnd then they yell, GET MOVING,â Bracero wrote. After Irma raked across Florida, he shared a video that someone had taken from high above a field near Jacksonville; the camera slowly panned across a sea of white bucket trucks that had assembled from all across the United States. âThatâs why Florida has light and we donât. Thatâs 16,000â workers, he wrote. âHere we are alone.â Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico just two weeks after Irma. âI have a very apocalyptic mind,â Bracero says, but the stormâs ferocity was nonetheless beyond what he could imagine. It brought sustained winds of 155 miles per hour and a 9-foot storm surge, cutting a roughly diagonal line across the island from the southeast over a span of nearly eight hours; its trajectory felt almost deliberate, as if plotted out to inflict the most damage. Bracero compared it to a terrorist attack. Eighty percent of Puerto Ricoâs electrical transmission lines went down. The entire island lost power. Bracero couldnât stand being idle anymore. After the storm, several employees of the San Juan power plant were unaccounted for. No one knew when, or if, they would return to work. Without hands on deck, Prepa was never going to get the lights back on. So Bracero pressured his doctor to sign a medical release. Of course, if youâre taking a blood thinner, a cut can be catastrophic, so the doctor agreed on the condition that Bracero wear an extra pair of gloves, an extra long-sleeve shirt, and a pair of spandex pants underneath his work clothes. When he looked in the mirror wearing this new uniform, Bracero laughed. In the boiling heart of a power plant the temperatures routinely soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but he was dressed as if he was going skiing. Once he was back at Prepa, Bracero quickly came to understand the magnitude of the damage. But his head was also still stuck in social media, whichâlike all media after the stormâwas maddening to him. News coverage appeared to be designed to spread panic. âMy wife and family were watching me yell at the television,â he says. Nor was Prepa doing a particularly effective job of communicating. So Bracero made another drastic move: âI decided to become a news outlet myself.â He started using his Facebook page to post daily updates on the effort to repair the grid. Favoring extreme transparency, he posted raw screenshots of the spreadsheets listing the work assignments of every power and light brigade on the island, alongside frank attempts to explain how the grid works and what it would take to get each part of it up and running. One day, when a steam turbine at a major power plant failed, he dug up an animated video about how steam turbines work. He warned that the clip was âASTRONOMICALLY BORINGâ but pointed people to the five-minute mark if they wanted to get a visual sense of the component that was broken. Toward the end of each post, Bracero would switch gears and offer a kind of running pep talk; he developed a voice that was simultaneously gentle, urgent, and reassuring, completely free of cynicism or panic. In practically every update, he implored his readers to post videos as soon as their lights came back on. âTomorrow help others cook, help those who have no light to feel a gift of normalcy,â he wrote to people who were about to regain power. âHelp wash clothes, help cook. Make Ice!â Heâd vary the message slightly, so it didnât seem like boilerplate. âIn the dark we have met again as neighbors. Donât forget,â he wrote. âDonât go back to your bubble.â To people whose pleas for help flooded his comments, he said: âThe moment will come. You are not forgotten.â When people did post images of their lights finally on, and photos of their freezers full of all the ice they had made for their neighbors, his response was unfailingly earnest. âIâm proud of you!â he wrote, again and again. By publicly sharing inside information from Prepa, Bracero knew he was taking a riskâhe was afraid he might lose his jobâbut he did it anyway. âIf I get fired, itâs for doing whatâs right,â he thought. By November, he had to switch over from his personal Facebook page to posting as a public figure on a fan page, because he was overwhelmed by posts, tags, and messages. Within a day, his new page had more than 12,000 followers. Someone made a portrait of Bracero in the style of Shepard Faireyâs famous image of Barack Obamaâan ersatz block print of Bracero with his long beard and hard hat, an enormous smile on his faceâand this became his public profile picture. People sometimes stopped him in the street to thank him, to give him a hug. In private, however, Bracero was frightened. Now that he was in contact with thousands of Puerto Ricans, he could feel how fragile they wereâhow fragile the whole island wasâafter the storm. âI wasnât expecting this level of desperation,â he told me. âIt scares the shit out of me.â Jorge Bracero, a power plant operator with Puerto Rico's public electric power authority, known as Prepa. All across Puerto Rico over the past year, people like Bracero have taken matters into their own hands in ways that are both inspiring and distressing. When it became clear to Javier JimÃ©nez, the mayor of a northwestern town called San SebastiÃ¡n, that power wasnât going to be restored right away after Maria, he decided to go rogue. He gathered a handful of brave (some might say reckless) city workers, along with a few retired Prepa employees willing to volunteer, and mobilized them to reconnect the 40,000-person town to the grid themselves. It was inordinately dangerous, but JimÃ©nez felt that the greater risk was inaction. San SebastiÃ¡n is about two hours from the capital, San Juan, and for many residents, particularly the elderly and the infirm, having electricity was a matter of life and death. âIt was a state of emergency,â the mayor told me. âNobody couldâve stood in my way. Not Prepa. Not the governor. Not the president of the United States.â JimÃ©nez called his band of vigilante line workers the PPAâthe Pepino Power Authorityâafter the surrounding Pepino mountains. The PPA asked men and women in San SebastiÃ¡n to come out with their own machetes to prune back the brush and tree limbs, helping clear a path to fallen poles near their homes. Then the PPAâs core team of volunteers would step in, repairing poles, scavenging parts, and running new cable. Officially, Prepa was not pleased to have a local amateur utility reconnecting high-voltage power lines. Unofficially, Prepa employees were slipping spare parts to the renegade municipal power crew, one volunteer told me, to help speed up the reelectrification. In another town, Adjuntas, nestled in the mountains about an hour and a half southwest of San Juan, an NGO dedicated in part to solar power, called Casa Pueblo, became a pillar of the local recovery. When the townâs 18,000 residents were cut off from the rest of the island after Maria, the NGOâs solar-Â­powered radio helped authorities find out which roads were clear and which families were in danger, and attend to emergencies when the central government and federal authorities were not yet responding. Casa Pueblo subsequently gave out some 14,000 solar-powered lamps and also offered a solar-charged satellite phone at its offices for locals to use. At any given time, five to 10 people waited to make a call. Arturo Massol, the associate director of Casa Pueblo and an ardent evangelist for decentralized, renewable energy, described what was happening on the island as âan energy insurrection.â Ordinary Puerto Ricans, he said, had woken up to the fact that when it came to electricity, they would have to look for alternatives. âTomorrow help others cook, help those who have no light to feel a gift of normalcy,â Bracero wrote to people who had regained power. ""Help wash clothes, help cook. Make Ice!â On the mainland, green-tech commentators pointed to Maria as an opportunity to turn the island into a laboratory for experimenting with microgrids, renewables, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Two weeks after the storm, a Twitter user in Virginia named Scott Stapf issued a hypothetical challenge: âCould @elonmusk go in and rebuild Puerto Ricoâs electricity system with independent solar & battery systems?â Musk replied with characteristic bravado: âThe Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too.â Puerto Ricoâs governor, Ricardo RossellÃ³, tweeted back: âLetâs talk.â But as they waited for the lights to come on, the vast majority of Puerto Ricans found alternatives to the grid in the most obvious, least sustainable places. Diesel and gas generators became the islandâs constant, deafening background noise. Long orange extension cords slithered out of windows, connecting houses to one another, as neighbors shared the power their generators were producing. (One of Braceroâs constant refrains on Facebook was a set of pleading instructions on how to power multiple houses using one generator without hurting anyone.) During its busiest period after the storm, one store in San Juan was selling about 400 generators a day. In the town of RÃ­o Grande, less than an hour east of San Juan, the Puerto Rican journalist Ana Teresa Toro told me the hurricane had forced her to rethink the viability of the island itself. âYou canât trust the infrastructure anymore,â she said. Barely anyone she knew had stayed at their normal weight after the storm: Without consistent refrigeration, people either ate processed food and put on pounds or they suffered through shortages and depression and lost weight. Toro told me some of her friends joked darkly about the thrilling results of this diet. Heroic improvisation and gallows humor can only get a population of 3.3 million people so far. Electricity is, of course, the utility upon which modernity rests. Without it, there can be nothing approaching normalcy. And the crippling cost of keeping generators fueled just underlined how essential grid power was. Solar power, meanwhile, was uneven without powerful battery backupsâand while the number of such batteries on the island was growing, thanks to companies like Tesla, there were still hardly enough to make a dent in demand (see âBalloons, Batteries, and the Crypto Invasionâ). Yes, Prepa was a basket caseâdysfunctional, archaic, overwhelmingly reliant on imported oilâbut it was still palpably and undeniably Puerto Ricoâs most critical infrastructure. However Â­little people trusted it, there were very few ways around relying on it. As the post-Maria period moved past its feverish first few weeks, electrical power inevitably became the simplest way of measuring progress toward recovery. And Bracero became one of the most trusted voices on technical questions that had come to feel like existential ones. How many people are connected now? What percentage of the population? When is the 50900 transmission line going to be operative again? The bigger question was not so much whether the crisis would lead to a new model for climate resilience, but whether the existing system would even be up and running by the next hurricane season. Doing so would require repairing far more than the damage caused by a single storm in September 2017. Javier JimÃ©nez, the mayor of San SebastiÃ¡n, took power restoration into his own hands and founded the Pepino Power Authority. Arturo Massol, the associate director of the NGO Casa Pueblo, describes Puerto Rico's response to the aftermath of Maria as an ""energy insurrection."" When Jorge Bracero began working for Prepa back in 2005, it was an institution that commanded some respect. By some measures, Prepa was (and still is) the largest public electric utility in the US, serving more customers than the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power or the Long Island Power Authority. Its grid, splayed across the rugged landscape of Puerto Rico, had been instrumental in the islandâs economic development. Its finances were sound. âI chose to be a blue-collar worker,â Bracero recalls. But as it happened, 2005 was also around the time when Puerto Ricoâs entire economy began a long, as yet unchecked slide, taking Prepa with it. The causes of the collapse were no mystery. For decades, federal tax law had offered US corporations major exemptions if they set up shop in Puerto Rico. Waves of this tax-incentivized industrialization had brought petrochemical plants, and then pharmaceutical and tech companies, to the island. But by 2006 the last of those tax breaks were phased out, and an exodus of Puerto Ricoâs industrial employers began in earnest. The islandâs GDP per capita fell in tandem. Unemployment spiked. Between 2000 and 2015, as economic stagnation took hold, nearly 10 percent of the population, mostly working-Â­age Puerto Ricans, left for the mainland. The islandâs tax base became a hopelessly moving target. From 2002 to 2014, the Puerto Rican government overestimated its revenue eight times, on one occasion by as much as 19 percent. Deficits grew year after year. To cover costs, Puerto Rico began to borrow heavily, issuing bonds to close budgetary gaps in ways that might be charitably described as creative. And they were easy to sell, in part because of another quirk in the US tax code: Earnings on Puerto Rican bonds were triply exempt from state, federal, and the islandâs own territorial taxes. Investment banks, retirement funds, and individual investors from the island and the mainland bought billions of dollarsâ worth, helping to prop up what amounted to a fiscal Ponzi scheme. By 2015 the situation was untenable, and then-Â­governor Alejandro GarcÃ­a Padilla declared that Puerto Ricoâs $72 billion in debts were not payable, setting into motion a series of negotiations with bondholders that culminated in an unelected oversight board taking control of the islandâs finances. Since then, to pay off creditors, Puerto Ricans have borne draconian cuts in education, public transportation, health, and utilities. As the most economically mobile Puerto Ricans have fled the island, these cuts have fallen on a population that is older, poorer, more isolatedâand angrierâthan ever. May Day protests in the past two years have turned violent. What Tech Has—and Hasnât—Done for Puerto Rico Puerto Ricoâs Governor: The Island Is Ready to Welcome Tech The years of austerity and economic contraction took a particularly harsh toll on Prepa. In 2016 a report ordered by the regulatory body in charge of overseeing Prepa laid bare the utilityâs sorry state with grim clarity: âPrepaâs generation, transmission, and distribution systems are falling apart,â it said. Prepaâs electrical service had cost more than other US utilities, yet its customer interruption rates were four or five times higher. As a result of âhistorically thin budgets,â Prepa had adopted a self-Â­defeating policy of postponing maintenance and extending outages to avoid paying overtime to its employees. Blackouts had become more frequent, the report said, while the rate of worker injuries and fatalities in Prepaâs shrinking workforce was âalarming.â Some of the utilityâs challenges were a legacy of Puerto Ricoâs industrial past. The islandâs largest power plants had been built on its less populated southern coast, to serve a now mothballed set of massive petrochemical plants nearby. Now those power facilities were primarily responsible for supplying electricity to the major population centers some 50 miles away on the islandâs northern coast, via transmission lines that had to cross a rugged, heavily jungled mountain range. Maintaining those lines was an extraordinary task even in the best of times. The utility was, according to the reportâs authors, stuck in a vicious cycle: The precarious state of the grid, which lurched from outage to outage, precluded the kind of massive, visionary investments needed to shore up or renovate the system. Not that Prepaâs leadership seemed much inclined toward vision. Prepa administrators were alleged to have participated in a fraudulent scheme to accept kickbacks in exchange for buying low-quality fuel oil at inflated prices. A 2016 report from a special investigative committee of the Puerto Rican Senate found that labs working for Prepa had manipulated tests of sulfur content in its fuel to cover the utilityâs tracks. The scheme is alleged to have involved billions of dollarsâ worth of contracts.
(A class action filed on behalf of customers is still pending.) On top of it all, the utility was more than $9 billion in debt. Well before the apocalyptic 2017 hurricane season, one thing had been made very clear to all Puerto Ricans: It didnât take a hurricane to knock out Prepaâs grid. On the afternoon of September 21, 2016, almost exactly a year before Maria made landfall, a single power switch overheated at the islandâs largest power plant, causing a cascading blackout that snuffed out the lights for 1.5 million customers. As if to underline the systemâs fragility, all of this happened under clear skies. By December 2017, San Juan felt half-empty, permeated by the rumble of generators and the sharp smell of diesel. Puerto Ricans had been leaving for the mainland by the thousands each week. It was common to find wreckage that had yet to be cleared; at major intersections, one side of the street might be lit up and the other still dimâa bolsillo, or pocket, of darkness. The pattern of illumination followed no discernible logic. According to best estimates, roughly half of Puerto Ricans were still living without power. A sketch comedy troupe called Teatro Breve was putting on five sold-out shows a week in San Juan, all about living without power, waiting in lines for no reason, and the myriad daily indignities that made up the post-hurricane ennui. The crowdâs laughter was deep and guttural, almost pained. In one scene, an actor berated her skeptical husband: âThe lights arenât going out today. Jorge Bracero said so!â Outside, on the streets, there were work crews everywhereâline workers from Prepa and from Florida, New York, and Texas in bucket trucks. The Army Corps of Engineers was also on the scene, but federal rules prevented them from upgrading Prepaâs grid. They had to âreplace in kindâ: A wooden electrical pole felled by Maria had to be replaced by another wooden pole, even if a metal one might better withstand the next storm. Ordinary Prepa employees I spoke to approached their work with a sense of pride and resignation. I spent an afternoon with one brigade of Prepa line workers doing repairs near the city of BayamÃ³n. Raul LebrÃ³n, a grizzled 21-year veteran of the utility, showed me parts he and his coworkers had scavenged from fallen transmission lines, cleaned up, and were now set to reuse. He held a brown porcelain insulator in his hand and estimated it was around 60 years old. The ingenuity of Prepaâs line workers astonished their colleagues from the mainland. Johnny Price, a Con Edison manager from New York who oversees line workers, spent six weeks in Puerto Rico that winter and told me heâd never seen work like this before. âThey see a pole, they stop, strip it, use what they can. They would reach into oil-filled transformers and start rewiring on the fly. They do calculations in their head. It was pretty impressive.â But no one could be impressed by the overall slow pace of recovery. In January, Governor RossellÃ³ made an announcement. âThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has become a heavy burden on our people, who are now hostage to its poor service and high cost,â he said. He announced his intention to privatize Prepa and sell off its assets, and signaled that he intended to move fast. Prepa line workers return power to a home in Puerto Rico. By spring, the number of customers for whom power had been restored in Puerto Rico had climbed past 1.4 million, but it could lurch down again in an instant. On February 11, an explosion at the Monacillos power plant plunged the capital back into darkness. A few weeks later, in early March, blackouts hit San Juan once more, two days in a row. On April 12, a tree fell along one of the islandâs electrical transmission lines near Salinas, knocking out power to nearly 1 million people. Six days later, a contractor hit a line with an excavator and the island went dark once more. âAs soon as the lights go out, my phone blows up,â Bracero told me in April. âPeople are traumatized.â He was as busy as ever at work, recovered from his injuries, and posting all the time. During the second blackout that month, one of Braceroâs updates was shared more than 4,000 times and gathered hundreds of comments. The thread included conspiracy theories about the privatization effort, speculating that the outages were part of a plan to further delegitimize the utility, paving the way for RossellÃ³âs deal. All day long, Bracero provided updates, trying to maintain the same tone of serenity he had been using since the hurricane. That month, I went to see Francisco RullÃ¡n, the official appointed by Governor RossellÃ³ to direct public energy policy and help oversee the governmentâs privatization plans for Prepa. His office sits in what is known as La Milla de Oro, San Juanâs Golden Mile, the cityâs financial center. There isnât much thatâs golden about it anymore, the disrepair and blight that preceded the storm apparent even here in boarded-up windows and half-empty office buildings. A modest gathering of former teachers stood in front of the building, protesting cuts to their pensions and school closures, posing for pictures in front of their homemade signs, and handing out flyers to passersby. Before assuming his current role, RullÃ¡n had worked as an engineer at Prepa for more than two decades, so he knew the utility from the inside and was keenly aware of both its assets and its shortcomings. But Prepaâs inability to fulfill its mission of providing consistent electricity to Puerto Rico was, no matter how you looked at it, a scandal. It was, after all, an inefficient state monopoly that lost money despite its captive customer base. âMy entire family still has no power,â he told me, just moments after weâd sat down. He was referring to his parents, who lived in a town called Utuado, in the islandâs mountainous center. âI always use them as an example. Going without power has become normal.â He encouraged me to visit them so I could see for myself. The first step in the privatization plan, RullÃ¡n told me, was to get Puerto Ricoâs legislative assembly to change the law to allow Prepa to sell its assets. The next step would be to get buyers lined upâeither for the entire utility or for different elements of Prepaâs broad portfolio: its aging plants, tens of thousands of miles of power lines, irrigation systems, right-of-way easements, and fiber-optic cable, to say nothing of its contracts with thousands of employees and its considerable debt. The new Prepa, he assured me, would offer lower prices for the consumer, more options, 50 percent renewable fuel sources by 2040, microgrids, and more. But many observers were skeptical. RossellÃ³âs proposed bill to privatize Prepa had explicitly blocked the utilityâs regulator, the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, from overseeing the sale of private contracts. The plan instead stipulated that Prepaâs seven-member governing board would run the 18-month-long process. The credit-rating agency Moodyâs called the timeline âquite aggressive.â Cathy Kunkel, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, worried that privatization without regulatory oversight would just open up opportunities for corrupt, politically driven business deals. Prepaâs leaders, after all, had already been accused of taking kickbacks and making bad deals for their customers, as with the fuel oil scandal. And the fact remained that Prepa was the largest single public asset in all of Puerto Ricoâthe biggest thing the territory had left to sell off. What terms might a buyer demand to purchase a creaking electrical system that provides power to a shrinking customer base on an island sure to be hit by more storms and hurricanes? In a report that Kunkel helped author, the IEEFA was particularly dubious that a new private owner, absent robust regulation, would voluntarily shift toward renewable fuel sources: Why would you pave the way for distributed forms of energy generation, like solar, when they compete with the centralized power grid youâve just bought? I asked RullÃ¡n what the model was for a wholesale transformation of a public utility like the one he was proposing. He shook his head; Puerto Rico would be the model. His tone wasnât boastful; it was optimistic in a way that felt surprising, given the context. âWhat we do here will make history,â he said. JosÃ© Roman, then the interim president of the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, the sidelined regulatory body overseeing Prepa, was less optimistic. He wasnât opposed to privatization in principle, but he had Â­little faith in the process that had been set in motion. Privatized energy markets have to be designed carefully: Supply and demand must always be in balance, or the entire system fails. He feared that the sale would become yet another missed opportunity for the Puerto Rican consumer. âYes,â he told me. âWe will be studied. Weâll be studied for everything we did wrong.â A shower that has been rigged to work without electrical pumps at a nursing home. The facility, run by Luz Collazo (pictured), went without grid power for nine months. During my final trip to Puerto Rico in April, I decided to visit Utuado, the town where RullÃ¡n had said his family was still living without power. Along the road there, I ran into two men picking up telephone wire that had been knocked down by the storm. Michael Casiano and Carmelo Fuentes were cutting the cable they had gathered into meter-long lengths, stacking the pieces in the bed of their beat-up truck, and then bringing it to someone from the phone company, they told me. They seemed happy to have a job. Casiano was tall and thin, wearing dark glasses. He had a broad, friendly smile. Fuentes was heavyset and strong, with thick arms and giant hands. Fuentes told me heâd almost lost his mind after Maria, and though I barely pressed him, it soon became clear he wasnât speaking in metaphor. His family had had no water and never managed to buy a generator. Everything seemed hopeless. One of Fuentesâ neighbors, a 22-year-old woman, had hung herself. The young womanâs mother and brother had followed suit, though both survived. I asked Fuentes how he knew he was having mental troubles. âBecause I was arrested,â he told me. He woke up in a straitjacket. But he was better now. He smiled bravely, as if to prove it. Casiano wanted to agree but instead offered: âPuerto Rico canât withstand another one of these.â Along the way to Utuado, the roads narrow and snake. These sparsely populated towns up in the hills, where the brush is thick and the trees curve over the roads, may well be the last places where power is restored. If another massive storm comes, residents worry theyâll find themselves once more at the back of the line. RullÃ¡nâs parents met me halfway up the hill, and we drove up together toward a small nursing home called Ciudad Dorada, Madre de Dios, which was still operating without grid power. Its director, Luz Collazo, told me she couldnât afford to use her generator much; she was spending around $300 a week on diesel. She had invested thousands of dollars in solar panels, but the building was too large for them to power it all at once. A visitor staying in the home had died a few weeks after Maria. Two of Collazoâs 10 residents needed oxygen, more than half had Alzheimerâs, and all but one were over 80 years old. For hot showers, Collazo and her husband, Miguel, warmed water on the stove. They also gathered rainwater in a large plastic kiddie pool on the roof. Collazo took me out to the terrace, looking over a lush valley. âNo oneâs come to pick up the power lines,â she said. âNo oneâs even come to survey the damage.â What was most maddening was that the vast majority of the utility poles along the road to the nursing home had survived. In all, Collazoâs nursing home would go without grid power for nine months. By the spring, one piece of good news had arrived from Washington: The new congressional budget allowed for an exception to the usual rules of federal disaster funding, and now FEMA could pay for major upgrades and new designs for Prepaâs grid. But that exception was only guaranteed to apply as long as the utility stayed public. Nevertheless, on June 11, the Puerto Rican legislature approved a bill to privatize Prepa. And on June 20, three weeks after the start of the new hurricane season, Governor RossellÃ³ signed it into law. Exactly one month later, Prepa was in crisis once again. On July 11, the utilityâs CEO of just four months, a non-Spanish speaker named Walter Higgins, announced his resignation, citing personal reasons. There had been considerable public outcry over his salary, which at $450,000 ranked among the highest of American public electric utility CEOs. The utilityâs governing board, the same body that RossellÃ³ had hoped would oversee the privatization process, then appointed one of its own members as the new CEO. The new head promptly told a San Juan radio station that the $750,000 heâd accepted to work as director of the beleaguered utility was âa sacrifice.â Amid public uproar, the governor asked the board to lower his pay; rather than comply, more than half of the board members resigned in one extraordinary day. By the following week, yet another chief executive had been appointed, the fifth since the storm. In the midst of the shake-up, the governor was on his way to Russia to watch the World Cup soccer finals. Hurricane season was under way, and after the largest blackout in the history of the US, the utility charged with keeping the lights on appeared to be all but leaderless. For workers like Bracero, this was all demoralizing. When we last spoke, he confessed that heâd expected at some point to be named Prepaâs spokesperson, or at least moved to the communications team. But every time he broached the issue, the CEO of Prepa would resign, and Bracero would be back at square one. He still lived an odd double life: at once a public figure and a guy climbing around a power plant in a hard hat, reeking of diesel. Heâd been in talks to become an island-wide radio personality, and had in fact been scheduled to go on the air that week. But heâd had to postpone his debut: The San Juan plant was as understaffed as ever, and he had been working double shifts for two weeks straight. âIâve been doing this for 13 years,â he told me, with weariness in his voice. He wasnât sure how much longer he could keep going before he burned out.

164,Nitasha Tiku,"A Pew Research study finds that that 54 percent of US teens ages 13 to 17 worry they spend too much time on their phones, and 52 percent have taken steps to cut back.",2018-08-22 14:00:00,wired,Even Teens Worry That Teens Are Addicted to Their Phones,https://www.wired.com/story/even-teens-worry-that-teens-are-addicted-to-their-phones/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7c75335560bb1fedf11cbd/191:100/pass/Teens-Biz-883745980.jpg,"American teenagers have a complicated and sometimes contradictory relationship with their smartphonesâjust like the rest of us. A new Pew Research study shows that kids are trying to negotiate between worry that they spend too much time on their phones and anxiety when they are separated from their devices. The study, released Wednesday, found that 54 percent of US teens ages 13 to 17 worry they spend too much time on their phones, 52 percent have taken steps to cut back on their phone use, and 57 percent have tried to spend less time on social media. But efforts to cut back donât necessarily make teens happier: 56 percent of teens associate being away from their phones with feeling anxious, lonely, or upset. Whatâs more, Pew found that teens who worry about excessive screen time are not more likely to change their behavior. Among those who say they spend too much time on their phones, 53 percent have cut back on mobile usage. Thatâs not far from 55 percent of teens who have cut back, despite feeling like they spend too little or the right amount of time on their mobile device. What does it mean that roughly half of teens have tried to step away from their phones? Pew has not previously asked teens, so itâs hard to gauge, says senior researcher Monica Anderson. One indicator might be how teens view their peers: More than nine in 10 view spending too much time online as a problem facing people their age, including 60 percent of teens who say it is a major problem. Anderson says the same disconnect between anxiety and action is evident in Pewâs privacy surveys, in which adults who say they are concerned about surveillance and losing control of their data donât necessarily change their online habits. The survey comes amid growing concern about the harmful effects of âtech addiction,â particularly among young people. Critics blame unscrupulous and unrestrained managers of tech platforms for making it hard to put down your device. Industry insiders like Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist for Google, have highlighted manipulative software designs that trigger intermittent hits of dopamine to keep users glued to their screens. In fact, Pewâs new report shows that parents struggle with the same impulses over screen time, sometimes with worse results. Thirty-nine percent of parents say they often or sometimes lose focus at work checking their cellphone, compared to 31 percent of teens who reported losing focus in class for the same reason. Whatâs more, 51 percent of teens say they often or sometimes find their parent or caregiver to be distracted by a cellphone when they are trying to have a conversation with them. Tech giants have been keeping a close eye on the growing movement to make sure that time spent on social media is âtime well spent,â and the attendant moral panic around the mental and physical toll that smartphone use may have on kids. Since March, Facebook, for instance, has announced a number of initiatives and tools to assuage parents of teenagers, including the option to set a daily reminder on Facebook and Instagram when you have hit a preset time limit. Still, younger users represent a lucrative profit center, especially as growth slows at major online platforms. An internal Facebook memo obtained by BuzzFeed News shows the strategies companies can deploy to keep kids engaged, if they so choose. In the memo, the founder of TBH, a viral polling app that Facebook acquired last October because of its popularity with teens, outlines the âpsychological tricksâ he employed on high schoolers. But teens may eventually tire of being tricked. In July, Facebook shut TBH due to low usage. The modern telephone is ubiquitous, but it wasn't always that way.

165,Issie Lapowsky,"The social media companies removed hundreds of fake accounts with links to Iran and Russia that were engaged in \""coordinated inauthentic behavior.\""",2018-08-22 02:13:18,wired,Facebook and Twitter Eye Iran in Latest Fake Account Crackdown,https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-twitter-eye-iran-fake-account-crackdown/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7cb68e5560bb1fedf11ce7/191:100/pass/Zuck-Iran-FA-AP_18144667384348.jpg,"Following more than a year of unrelenting focus on Russian cyber attacks on Silicon Valley giants, Facebook and Twitter announced Tuesday night that they've now also thwarted a network of suspicious accounts that appear to originate in Iran. First, Facebook announced it had taken down 652 pages, groups, and accounts for ""coordinated inauthentic behavior."" Less than an hour after Facebook went public with the news, Twitter announced in a brief series of tweets that, working with ""industry partners,"" it had shut down 284 accounts, many of which it said were from Iran. The news is a reminder of the broad scope of potential adversaries targeting American tech companies. But it simultaneously signals a strengthening alliance between those companies, which have begun proactively sharing the details of their investigations with other tech giants. On a call with reporters Tuesday night, Facebook executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg described a multi-pronged investigation that unearthed several networks of bad actors. Some were associated with Russia, but others were affiliated with Iranian state media. ""These were networks of accounts that were misleading people about who they were and what they were doing,"" Zuckerberg explained. ""People need to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook."" The company credits the cybersecurity firm FireEye with detecting one group called Liberty Front Press, which was connected with several accounts and pages. They often posed as news organizations and civil society groups, but using publicly available website registration information and IP addresses, Facebook researchers found that the group was actually affiliated with Iranian state media. All in, more than 200,000 users followed at least one of these accounts or pages across Facebook and Instagram. Facebook didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment about whether any of these users had been notified. 'Iâve been saying for months that thereâs no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt.' Democratic senator Mark Warner In its own blog post Tuesday, FireEye cautioned that identifying the origins of these groups can be difficult, due to the nature of their activities, but said they had ""moderate confidence"" in their assessment about Iranian involvement. The post included a labyrinthine illustration that maps out the different pages and their web of promotion. According to FireEye, the network promoted issues that aligned with Iranian interests. Among the striking details they discovered were ""inauthentic social media personas, masquerading as American liberals supportive of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, heavily promoting Quds Day, a holiday established by Iran in 1979 to express support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel."" In addition to the Liberty Front Press network, Facebook found another set of accounts and pages posing as news organizations that the company says had ""links"" to the Liberty Front Press group. But this network launched more traditional attacks, attempting to hack into other Facebook users' accounts and spread malware. Facebook says it's working with law enforcement on further investigating its findings. The cyberthreat posed by Iran has been the subject of concern in intelligence circles for years. But when the US reached a deal with the country in 2015, which lifted key sanctions, Iran's cyber attacks seemed to have subsided. Meanwhile, the threat Russia posed only grew in the public consciousness after the 2016 election, when Russian actors hacked into the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chair's emails, while also carrying out an influence campaign across nearly every social media platform. And yet, lawmakers have recently cautioned against taking an overly myopic view of the scope of cyber threats facing the tech sector. During a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, just hours before Facebook's announcement, Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal warned, forebodingly, ""Until thereâs real action, Vladimir Putin will operate with impunity, and he will continue to use a playbook which becomes the same playbook used by other countries, notably Iran. I believe there will be news about Iranian aggression in the cyber domain."" Following Facebook's disclosure, Democratic senator Mark Warner said in a statement, âIâve been saying for months that thereâs no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt."" Facebook's discovery underscores the level of vigilance required to detect threats from multiple state actors at once, even as the company tries to find and memorize the fingerprints others have left behind. In addition to the two networks associated with Liberty Front Press, the company also detected a suspicious network that shared content about Middle East politics in Arabic and Farsi, and also shared content about the United States and United Kingdom in English. These 168 pages and 140 accounts racked up 823,000 followers across Facebook and Instagram. This group also ran $6,000 worth of ads, the oldest of which ran in 2012. Despite signals indicating these accounts and pages were connected, they ""were not presenting a coordinated front in how they identified themselves,"" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said on the press call. Facebook noted that it also shut down additional accounts and pages associated with Russian military intelligence, but the company was light on details about what this group shared or how many Facebook users followed them. The company was also reluctant to blame Russia for another suspicious network it shut down at the end of July, saying that all of these investigations are still ongoing. In his remarks to reporters, Zuckerberg continually stressed the need for tech companies and government agencies to work together to investigate and prevent these threats. His sentiment echoed Microsoft CEO Brad Smith, who earlier Tuesday also called on the government to act when he announced that Microsoft had thwarted a series of Russian cyber attacks on political groups in the United States. ""No one company can win this fight on its own,"" Zuckerberg said. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast. All rights reserved.
