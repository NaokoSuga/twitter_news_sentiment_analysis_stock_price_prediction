2,Will Carr,The most influential companies are preparing for misinformation campaigns.,2018-08-24 22:18:05,abc-news,Tech companies to meet to protect their platforms against foreign meddling,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/ahead-midterm-elections-tech-companies-meet-protect-platforms/story?id=57388549,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/facebook-users-rtr-jc-180329_hpMain_4_16x9_992.jpg,"
Members of the country's most influential tech companies met Friday to prepare for misinformation campaigns by foreign countries, including Russia, ahead of the midterm elections in November.
 
At least one company confirmed Friday's meeting, held in San Francisco, to ABC News.
 
The companies plan to discuss efforts to defend their platforms from the type of meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential election.
 
The meeting was first reported in BuzzFeed.
 
It comes after a tumultuous week in the cyber landscape. Microsoft announced Tuesday it took control of half a dozen websites that had been operated by the Russian military intelligence agency that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.
 
On Wednesday, Facebook and Twitter suspended or removed hundreds of accounts linked to Russia and Iran that displayed âinauthentic behavior.â
 
 
 
Fridayâs meeting comes on the heels of a meeting that took place in May between the top tech companies and United States intelligence officials. That meeting occurred at Facebookâs headquarters and included Twitter, Snap, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Oath, according to the New York Times.
 
 
 
According to reports, the tech companies walked away disappointed because intelligence officials refused to share information.
 
Tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, have come under heavy fire after federal authorities announced that Russian agents launched a misinformation campaign on social media in the United States during the 2016 election.
 
 
 
Earlier this month, a number of top U.S. national security leaders gathered in the White House Press Briefing Room and shared the same message: Russia is continuing to interfere in the U.S. political system.
 
 
 
At the time, Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen said: âFree and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and it has become clear that they are the target of our adversaries who seek to sow discord and undermine our way of life.â
 
 
 
In February, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russians, all members of a Russian intelligence agency, for trying to hack Democratsâ emails and computer networks.

It's also publicly promising to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 75% over the same timeframe, using 2017 as a base year.   The two goals are a significant new commitment towards green energy for Facebook, building on previous targets and giving it new concrete, measurable goals to work towards.   Tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple, consume extraordinary quantities of electricity to power their global networks of data centres and infrastructure.   These have the capacity to significantly contribute to global greenhouse emissions — though most of the major tech firms have made pledges towards renewable energy with varying levels of specificity.   In a 2017 report assessing the environmental credentials of tech firms, Greenpeace scored Apple most highly — hailing it as ""among the most aggressive in the sector in its efforts to power its online platform with renewable energy.""   Facebook also got an A-grade, with Greenpeace commending it: ""Facebook was the first major internet company to commit to be 100% renewably powered and continues to play a leadership role within the sector. Showing strong transparency and a track record of its five latest data centers sighted in locations that allowed them to be renewably powered.""   Google is ""improving its renewable energy deployment in new markets to keep pace with its rapid growth,"" Greenpeace said, but it ""still has significant room to improve in regards to transparency.""   Facebook previously set itself a goal of 25% renewables by 2015, and 50% by 2018 after that.                                                                       ""We work with utilities, renewable energy developers and industry groups to share our learnings and approaches with other companies. When doing so, we bring an open and innovative approach to finding renewable energy solutions that fit our needs and can move energy markets forward,"" Facebook said in a press release.   ""We work to enable access to renewable energy resources for other companies and organizations through green tariffs, building infrastructure or opening projects to other buyers.""  Got a tip?

Toyota is investing $500 million in Uber at a $72 billion valuation as part of a self-driving-car partnership. Uber's tech will be integrated into custom-built Toyota vehicles set to be used for a network of self-driving cars, with the first pilots scheduled for 2021.  2.  Some Apple insiders are referring to 2018 as an iPhone ""S"" year, referring to Apple's old system of introducing a new phone design one year and then speed upgrades — the S year — the next. According to Bloomberg, Apple could launch three new iPhones this year, all sporting a screen that covers the entire front of the device.  3.  Marketers are poring over legal documents to make sure they don't screw up using data on Facebook. Facebook is shutting down its Partner Categories ad program and replacing it with Custom Audiences, which will still allow third parties to work with brands in building audiences — but puts the data-protection onus on marketers.  4.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk started having second thoughts about taking his company private when advisers began lining up big-name investors, like rival car firms. According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk also regretted losing the small-fry shareholders who had been his biggest champions.  5.  Facebook barred Myanmar's top army official for ""serious human rights abuses"" as it tries to atone for its role in spreading misinformation in the country. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing is among the 20 Myanmarese and organizations now barred from Facebook.  6.  Officials identified the gamers Elijah Clayton and Taylor Robertson as the two people who died in the shooting at a ""Madden"" tournament in Jacksonville, Florida. The gaming community rallied on social media to pay tribute to the victims.  7.  Tinder's cofounder Sean Rad said he had ""no choice"" but to sell his stock in the dating-app maker a month before he left the company. According to The Verge, Rad was fired from Tinder's parent firm and would have lost the chance to exercise his options within 30 days.  8.  Microsoft introduced an ambitious subscription plan that makes the Xbox the best deal in gaming. The Xbox All Access plan starts at $22 a month for US players, giving subscribers an Xbox One console, two years of Xbox Live Gold service, and two years of Xbox Game Pass.  9.  Y Combinator's ambitious basic-income experiment has been delayed. In 2016, Y Combinator, the largest startup accelerator in Silicon Valley, said it would provide participants with money for five years after an initial pilot, but the pilot is taking a lot longer than anticipated.  10.  Oculus founder Palmer Luckey reviewed the Magic Leap One, a buzzy new mixed-reality device, and was absolutely brutal. Luckey described the device as ""a tragedy in the classical sense ... less of a functional developer kit and more of a flashy hype vehicle that almost nobody can actually use in a meaningful way.""

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images                                       Even so, Facebook and its family of apps take up an astonishing amount of the time people spend on their smartphones.   According to new data from app-analysis firm Apptopia seen by Business Insider, time spent in Facebook's apps make up almost a third of the all the time people spend on the 100 most popular apps across Apple's iOS and Google's Android mobile operating systems.   In other words, of every 100 minutes spent in the world's most popular apps, 32 of those are gobbled up by Facebook — whether that's in Facebook itself, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, or its other apps.   The data highlights how deeply Facebook has entrenched itself into people's digital lives, and the extent to which it has managed to dominate the mobile landscape, despite not building core platforms like Apple and Google.                                              Samantha Lee/Business Insider                                      Facebook even outstrips Google, according to Apptopia's data. Time spent in Google's apps — including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps — takes up 22% of the time spent in the top 100 apps across iOS and Android.   When the scope is widened to encompass the top 500 most popular apps, Facebook's and Google's share drops slightly, though they still take up an extraordinarily large amount of time, 20% and 14%, respectively.   Overall, between the start of May and the end of July, users spent a cumulative 300 billion hours on Facebook's apps, and 118 billion in Google's.                                                                                                           The top 10 apps, in terms of time spent, are, in order:   The data is worldwide, though it excludes third-party app stores, including in China (where Google's first-party app store, Google Play, is not available). ""We combine session data from both the app side and consumer side for our learning set, which our data science team then creates estimation models with,"" AppTopia communications lead Adam Blacker said in an email.   ""From the app side, more than 250,000 mobile app developer accounts are connected to Apptopia. From the consumer side, our SDK partner provides us with panel data from hundreds of millions of devices.""   The findings also highlight the success of Facebook's aggressive acquisition and spin-out strategy. Over the past few years, it has snapped up potential competitors and up-and-coming startups left, right, and center, while also spinning out core Facebook functions (Messenger, Local) into standalone apps.   Instagram, which it bought for a relatively paltry $1 billion in 2012,  is now worth an estimated $100 billion and has a whopping 1 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp, which it picked up for a more substantial $19 billion, in 2014, took up 85 billion hours of users' time alone in the three-month period measured by Apptopia.                                                                                                           Asked outright if he thought he had a monopoly at the Senate hearing, Zuckerberg responded to laughter that ""it certainly doesn't feel like that to me."" But regardless of whether Facebook's dominance technically qualifies as one, it clearly now owns an unprecedented mindshare of the worldwide app market.  Work at Facebook? Got a tip?

To be the first to know, please  click here.  Facebook is testing speech recognition technology — which would be a necessary part of any move into the smart speaker market — reports  TechCrunch.  createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');                                            Business Insider Intelligence                                      A video was discovered that showed that the company is testing a program called ""Aloha,"" which can recognize and transcribe speech. That same video includes references to ""Portal,"" the purported name of at least one of the rumored smart speakers that Facebook is reportedly developing.   This news would see to indicate that Facebook is putting together all of the ingredients necessary for a voice-activated smart speaker.   Facebook has been inching toward releasing a smart speaker for a number of months.Rumors initially  emerged last year that the social media giant was potentially looking to wade into the hardware market, but certain team heads within the company appeared  reticent to embrace the voice interface too fully and argued that it was immature and not ready for the role being proposed for it.   But the company has reportedly moved ahead with its efforts and developed two voice-powered smart speakers that it was planning to show off in May at its developer conference. These plans, though, were  scuttled by the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal.   Since then, the company has made  hardware hires and considered how best to proceed with the launch of its smart speakers, potentially looking to  international markets first. And now, the revelation of the Aloha voice interface is another key indicator that Facebook is preparing to move ahead with its smart speaker plans.   Facebook may be the dominant entity in social media, but it's never been a significant hardware player and could face a challenging path wading into this market. Its screen-equipped Portal smart speaker will  reportedly cost $499, higher than any competing devices from Apple, Google, or Amazon. And it won't have any track record to build upon, since Facebook hasn't offered any hardware or voice-based AI in the past.   It's also unclear who the target market for this smart speaker would be. Most of all, though, to convince those consumers who don't yet own a smart speaker to buy its Portal device, Facebook would need to overcome trust issues, which 41% of respondents to an  exclusive Business Insider Intelligence survey cited as the main reason they haven't bought a smart speaker yet.   Given the company's  trust issues, this will be another major hurdle to overcome if it looks to move into the consumer hardware market.  ",0.03,0.82,0.15,0.9946

AP                                      The world was a very different place 10 years ago.   A decade ago, you couldn't order an Uber on your phone. You couldn't surf the web on Google Chrome. You couldn't rent a place to stay on demand with Airbnb.   Several incredible products and services have been invented in the last 10 years — some, in the last five or eight. Thanks to a tweet from Button cofounder Chris Maddern, we were inspired to look into some of the cool, convenient things the tech world has invented since 2008.  Take a look.  When Steve Jobs introduced the iPad eight years ago, he described it was ""the best browsing experience you'll ever have.""   ""It's unbelievably great. Way better than a laptop, way better than a smartphone,"" Jobs said on stage in January 2010.   The original iPad cost between $499 and $829. Since then, the device has gone through several iterations and several price points — most recently, Apple unveiled a new $329, 9.7-inch iPad.   Google unveiled its Chrome browser on September 1, 2008.   ""On the surface, we designed a browser window that is streamlined and simple,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai (who was vice president of product management at the time) wrote on the official Google blog.   ""Like the classic Google homepage, Google Chrome is clean and fast,"" Pichai wrote. ""It gets out of your way and gets you where you want to go.""   Snapchat first launched on the App Store in the summer 2011 as a messaging app for sending disappearing photos. At the time, it was called Pictaboo, but it had the same now-famous ghost icon, Ghostface Chillah.   By September 2011, the name had changed to Snapchat and began to catch on with Los Angeles teens.   Six years later, Snapchat is owned by a $15.8 billion public company, Snap Inc., and has expanded into partnerships with publishers, TV-like shows, hardware products, and augmented reality.   The idea for Airbnb formed in 2007 when cofounder Joe Gebbia sent an email to his roommate, Brian Chesky, suggesting they rent out their apartment to make some extra money. After a few attempts, Air Bed & Breakfast finally launched in 2008 as an online platform for renting out spare room at your place, or for people to easily find and book inexpensive places to stay.   Airbnb is now working toward becoming a more full-service travel brand by offering curated experiences called Trips as well as high-end accommodations.   Nine years after launching, Airbnb is profitable and valued at about $38 billion, making it one of the highest-valued startups in the US.   Spotify launched in October 2008 in Stockholm, Sweden. The pair behind the company, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, came up with the name ""Spotify"" in 2005 when Lorentzon was sleeping on a bare mattress at Ek's apartment.   Spotify launched a public beta in the spring of 2007, but it wasn't until the company signed licensing deals with Sony, Universal, BMG, and more that Spotify officially launched. At first, anyone could buy a premium subscription, but the free version of Spotify was available by invite only.   Nearly a decade later, Spotify has 170 million active users worldwide.   Oculus VR began in a garage in Irvine, California in June 2012. Then-19-year-old Palmer Luckey launched the company on Kickstarter, raising nearly $2.5 million for his virtual reality headset. After raising an additional $16 million in funding, Luckey sold Oculus to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion.   Now, Luckey has left Oculus, but the VR company lives on at Facebook. You can buy an Oculus Rift and Touch for $499, and Facebook announced the $200 Oculus Go headset in 2017.   Stripe, a startup aimed at ""disrupting"" online payments, officially launched in September 2011. Now, companies from Target to the NFL use Stripe's technology to power payments in their websites and apps.    Seven years after launch, Stripe is worth about $9 billion.   Instagram first launched in October 2010 with 25,000 people signing up on the first day. By 2011, Instagram was Apple's iPhone app of the year, and by April 2012, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shelled out $1 billion to buy the company.   Instagram now has 1 billion active users and has branched into direct messaging, has launched a clone of Snapchat Stories that now has more monthly users, and has added live video, face filters, stickers, and more. In June, Instagram launched a long-form video service called IGTV.   Kickstarter, the platform for launching and backing independent companies and products, got its start in April 2009 after cofounder Perry Chen wanted a way to crowdsource the cost of inviting musicians to a jazz fest in New Orleans.   The first-ever product was a Grace Jones t-shirt created by Chen that didn't meet its fundraising goal.   Since then, over 15 million people have backed projects and $3.8 billion has been raised on the site.   GPS certainly wasn't invented in the aughts — it's actually been around since 1978, and available for commercial use since 1993. But it wasn't until 2008 and 2009 that GPS became widely available on phones.   Early Apple fans could use it on the iPhone 3G, and by 2009, the iPhone could handle turn-by-turn navigation (TomTom even offered a $100 app for it).   The same year, Android adopters could get GPS for free: Google created free turn-by-turn navigation software to Android smartphones.    Lyft launched in 2012 as a ride-sharing app. The idea morphed out of Zimride, a company founded by John Zimmer and Logan Greene that offered carpooling for long-distance rides and campus car-sharing programs.   Fast-forward to 2018 and Lyft now says it has 1.4 million drivers in the US and Toronto and is valued at $15.1 billion.   Pinterest, a search and discovery app and virtual ""pinboard,"" was founded in March 2010.   Today, the app has 200 million monthly active users and the company is valued betweb $13 billion and $15 billion. The company plans to go public by mid-2019.   Pinterest is also moving on from basic searching and pinning: The company is experimenting with shopping, machine learning and vision, and camera search both in the app and around the web.    Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey launched Square in October 2010 after a friend of his couldn't make a sale because he couldn't process American Express cards.    Square was conceived as a mobile payments service that could process credit cards with an app and a reader that plugged into smartphones.    These days, Square is a $29 billion public company.   4G networks may seem like a given these days, but they've only been around for about seven years. The networks promised to make the mobile internet much faster and much better and were an upgrade the 3G wireless network.    Sprint's HTC Evo was the first 4G phone by several months — it came out in March 2010, followed by a Samsung model in June of that year. Verizon didn't launch 4G until December 2010, and 4G didn't come to the iPhone until the iPhone 5 in 2012.    Uber was founded in March 2009 as a black-car service called UberCab. Garrett Camp, Oscar Salazar, and Conrad Whelan build the first version, with Travis Kalanick serving as a ""mega adviser"" and later, CEO. Over the years, Uber has expanded to offer peer-to-peer ride-sharing, car-pooling, luxury rides, and more.   While the company has been mired in scandal after scandal in the last several months, Uber remains the world's most valuable startup at about $62 billion and its business is still growing.   Venmo first went online in 2009. The startup originally began as a music startup, but the founders decided to switch to payments after founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail came to visit cofounder Andrew Kortina in New York City for the weekend and forgot his wallet.    Venmo was acquired by Braintree in 2012 for $26.2 million, which in turn sold to PayPal in 2013.    Jan Koum incorporated WhatsApp in 2009 before the app had even been written. He and cofounder Brian Acton decided to make it a messaging app, building the company in a converted warehouse they shared with Evernote.   The app grew organically, particularly in developing countries that relied on SMS texting. WhatsApp caught the attention of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2012 and by 2014, Zuckerberg bought the app for $19 billion.   Founder Stewart Butterfield started working on work chat app Slack in 2012. The first iteration of the app was a web-based massively multiplayer game, but it didn't quite work out. Fast-forward to 2013 and the Slack team knew they had a product on their hands that other companies would actually use.    ""We begged and cajoled our friends at other companies to try it out and give us feedback,"" Butterfield said in an interview with venture capital firm First Round Capital.    Most recently, Slack raised $250 million at a $5.1 billion valuation from SoftBank's Vision Fund, Accel, and other investors.    Get the latest Snap stock price here.  ",0.008,0.899,0.093,0.9988

Drew Angerer/Getty Images                                       The news was first reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed its removal to Business Insider. It's still available from the Google Play store on Android.   Onavo, an Israeli security firm acquired by Facebook in 2013, has long been the source of controversy.   Its flagship app, Onavo Protect, offers users a number of security features, including security alerts and access to a virtual private network (VPN). But it also monitors the apps that users use, reporting the data back to Facebook HQ — something the social network has used to identify competitors early and even prompt acquisitions.   According to the WSJ's report, Apple came to the conclusion that the app broke its new rules on data collection, and told Facebook as much earlier in August.   Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment,  but a company spokesperson told CNBC:   ""We work hard to protect user privacy and data security throughout the Apple ecosystem. With the latest update to our guidelines, we made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a user's device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing and must make it clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used.""   In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""We've always been clear when people download Onavo about the information that is collected and how it is used. As a developer on Apple's platform we follow the rules they've put in place.""   According to previous reports from the Wall Street Journal, Facebook has used Onavo to do everything from  monitoring usage of competing apps like Snapchat to  surfacing up-and-coming apps like videochat app Houseparty, and then cloning its core features.                                                                                               Critics have long held that Facebook doesn't do enough to advertise its ownership of Onavo — you have to scroll all the way to the bottom of its description in smartphone app stores to see that disclosure; something not every would-be user may do. Earlier this year, privacy advocates were upset when the  core Facebook app suggested users download Onavo Protect, without disclosing that relationship. It's been called ""vampiric"" and ""spyware"" by pundits.   A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment as to whether the company will take action on Onavo of its own.

Rose, who joined the company in 2006, announced his departure in a post to his Facebook page on Wednesday. In the 12 years he's been with Facebook, Rose oversaw the social network's relationships with other companies, serving as the vice president of partnerships.   Rose is the latest in a string of high-profile executive departures at Facebook as the company finds itself buffeted by a storm of controversies, including the use of its platform to spread misinformation and interfere in elections around the world.   Rose said his departure was for personal reasons, writing in his post that he wanted to be with his family, which moved to Hawaii last year. He said that he ""semi-commuted"" between Hawaii and Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters, but has now decided to live full-time in the island state to better focus on his family.   ""[Facebook CEO] Mark [Zuckerberg] and [COO] Sheryl [Sandberg] changed my life and my career. I would walk through fire for them, or fly across the ocean on a regular basis,"" writes Rose.   ""But they deserve someone in my role who is present and fully engaged every day in the many opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.""   Before Facebook, Rose was at Amazon, where he helped introduce the Kindle e-book reader. At Facebook, he helped negotiate a deal with Apple that saw its social features integrated with the iPhone, as well as an advertising deal with Microsoft that later turned into a $240 million investment that valued the company at $15 billion.   In his Facebook post, Rose said that he plans to stay on through at least the Mobile World Congress event in early February, leaving him time to come up with a formal plan for the transition. He noted that he's not ruling out the possibility of taking some other role with Facebook. And he said he plans to invest and advise smaller companies.   Rose's exit is the latest departure from Facebook's bench of seasoned executives.

Trump’s attack against the Alphabet Inc unit follows a string of grievances against technology companies, including social media Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc, which he has accused of silencing conservative voices, and Amazon.com Inc, which he has said is hurting small businesses and benefiting from a favorable deal with the U.S. Postal Services. He frequently berates news outlets for what he perceives as unfair coverage.  Google denied any political bias, saying in a statement that its search engine is “not used to set a political agenda and we don’t bias our results toward any political ideology.”  Trump said in several tweets on Tuesday that Google search results for “Trump News” were “rigged” against him because they showed only coverage from outlets like CNN and not conservative publications, suggesting the practice was illegal.  “I think Google is really taking advantage of our people,” Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. “Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful. It’s not fair to large portions of the population.”  Facebook declined to comment. Twitter did not comment when asked for a response. In congressional testimony, both companies have denied engaging in partisan censorship.  Neither Trump nor the White House detailed how or under what legal justification they would use to probe Google.   Trump’s economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later told reporters that the White House was “taking a look” at Google, saying the administration would do “some investigation and some analysis,” without providing further details.  Earlier this summer, the new Republican chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. In a previous investigation, the FTC decided that Google was likely justified in developing a search function that harmed other companies.  In June Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Google’s alleged anticompetitive behavior in the online search and advertising markets.  Congressional sources cautioned that it may be difficult for Trump to find a way to probe Google about news search results, and that Congress is unlikely to pass any applicable laws.   U.S. member of Congress Ted Lieu, a Democrat, said in a tweet directed at Trump that such restrictions on Google would violate the U.S. Constitution: “If government tried to dictate the free speech algorithms of private companies, courts would strike it down in a nanosecond.”     Shares of Alphabet closed down 0.8 percent at $1,245.86.  While the exact science behind Google searches on the internet is kept secret, its basic principles are widely known to be generated with a variety of factors measured by the company’s algorithms.  The factors Google uses to determine which websites appear first in search results include how often that page is linked to on other sites, the use of keywords, the popularity and respectability of the news site, and personal browsing history of the person conducting the search.   Highly trafficked and cited websites like CNN.com and NYTimes.com, two of the most Trump’s most frequent targets, often appear first in search results.      Trump’s accusation of bias on the part of Google comes as social media companies have suspended accounts, banned certain users and removed content as they face pressure from the U.S. Congress to police foreign propaganda and fake accounts aimed at disrupting American politics, including operations tied to Iran and Russia.       Companies such as Facebook and Twitter have also been pressed to remove conspiracy driven content and hate speech.      Tech companies have said they do not remove content for political reasons.      Some Republican U.S. lawmakers have also raised concerns about social media companies removing content from some conservatives, and have called Twitter’s chief executive to testify before a House of Representatives panel on Sept. 5.  Earlier this month, Alphabet’s YouTube joined Apple Inc and Facebook in removing some content from Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones was also temporarily suspended on Twitter.

Can’t do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN, whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!” Trump wrote on Twitter, not mentioning any specific companies.  Trump also criticized social media outlets last week, saying without providing proof that unidentified companies were “totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices.”   Those tweets followed actions taken by Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Facebook Inc (FB.O) to remove some content posted by Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones’ own Twitter account was temporarily suspended on Aug. 15.  In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump said it was “very dangerous” for social media companies like Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook to silence voices on their services.  Trump’s comments also come as the social media industry faces mounting scrutiny from Congress over the policing of foreign propaganda.  On Tuesday, Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet removed hundreds of accounts tied to an alleged Iranian propaganda operation, while Facebook took down a second campaign it said was linked to Russia.  U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia tried to influence the 2016 presidential election by hacking and other actions, including using social media in an influence campaign.  When asked by Reuters about Trump’s allegations of censorship, Twitter pointed to the three hours of sworn testimony that its head of public policy strategy, Nick Pickles, recently gave to a House of Representatives committee. He said claims that Twitter is banning conservative voices are unfounded and false and that it works to define and act upon “bad conduct, not a specific type of speech.”  Representatives for Facebook declined to comment.

In a reorganization spanning three sectors, none of the so-called FANG high-growth stocks - Facebook (FB.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - will be classified as technology companies, even though investors widely view them as the leaders of a tech rally that has powered the stock market higher in recent years.  On Sept. 24, S&P; will shift Alphabet, Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N), Paypal (PYPL.O) and videogame makers Electronic Arts (EA.O) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) from the S&P; 500 technology index to an expanded telecom group, renamed “Communications Services.”   Netflix, which like Amazon, is currently part of the consumer discretionary group, will also move to the expanded telecom group. Amazon will stay put in consumer discretionary.  The changes are part the largest-ever reorganization of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, an industry taxonomy widely used by investors. MSCI will adjust its indexes in November.   Meant to reflect the economy’s evolution, the overhaul of GICS will affect how mutual fund managers choose between stocks, and force passively managed sector funds to reallocate billions of dollars. Removing Alphabet and Facebook from technology indexes may lead investors to pay more attention to smaller, remaining technology companies.  “People will be able to get a clear look at the tech sector without being overwhelmed by these behemoths that really are media companies,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.   Exchange-traded funds that passively track indexes have about $89 billion invested in the technology sector, much of which will have to be reinvested to stay in line with the sector changes, potentially creating volatility, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper.  While many individual investors will still view Alphabet and Facebook as tech stocks, mutual funds have internal rules limiting how much they can invest across different sectors.  With Facebook and Alphabet shifted into the communications sector, fund managers will no longer have to choose between them and Apple or Microsoft (MSFT.O), or bets on chipmakers and cloud-computing, said Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Palfrey.   “And at the same time, an investor can go to the communications sector and overweight an internet services company against a traditional telecom company,” Palfrey said. “This is important for investors who have mandates to stay within certain parameters of a sector.”    Technology stocks have been top performers driving Wall Street’s gains in recent years, including Apple (AAPL.O), which currently makes up 16 percent of the S&P; 500 IT index .SPLRCT.   Apple will increase its weight in that index to 20 percent following the removal of No. 2 component Alphabet and Facebook, its fourth largest member.  The changes will also increase the weight of smaller tech companies. Microsoft, Visa (V.N), Intel (INTC.O) and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) will round out the S&P; 500 IT index’s largest five components, followed by Mastercard (MA.N), Oracle (ORCL.N)  and Nvidia (NVDA.O).

19,Justin Hendrix,Misinformation and polarization are forms of pollution exacerbated by social media business models — and social media companies should pay to clean it up.,2018-08-24 21:12:00,nbc-news,It's time for Big Tech to pay for the pollution it creates,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/facebook-youtube-twitter-cannot-rely-outsiders-police-misinformation-their-own-ncna902671,https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_34/2537541/180820-jack-dorsey-se-534p_613b2d02f25a9f7f7b5f1094aa14a0d1.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg," Justin Hendrix is Executive Director of NYC Media Lab, a consortium of universities and media companies exploring emerging media technology. NYC Media Labâs membership includes NBCUniversal. Opinions expressed here are entirely his own. Follow him on Twitter (@justinhendrix). The ongoing controversy over Twitterâs decision not to permanently ban Infowars extremist Alex Jones following similar moves by companies such as Apple and Facebook landed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in front of NBCâs Lester Holt last week. Dorsey attempted to explain himself on a variety of thorny questions involving free speech and what he refers to as âsensationalistâ and âde-humanizingâ use of his platform, on which misinformation and harassment continues to be a serious problem. One particular exchange between Holt and Dorsey highlighted a significant flaw in the logic of social media executives confronting misinformation: that it is the job of journalists to debunk misinformation, and not the responsibility of platforms. In tweets responding to the Infowars controversy, Dorsey stated that âaccounts like Jones' can often sensationalize issues and spread unsubstantiated rumors, so itâs critical journalists document, validate, and refute such information directly so people can form their own opinions. This is what serves the public conversation best.â Holt questioned Dorsey on this point: âYou put the onus on journalists to police some of the misinformation thatâs put out there, is that fair?â In reply, Dorsey admitted to Holt: âNo I donât believe itâs completely fair. I went a little too far in that push.â We didnât suspend Alex Jones or Infowars yesterday. We know thatâs hard for many but the reason is simple: he hasnât violated our rules. Weâll enforce if he does. And weâll continue to promote a healthy conversational environment by ensuring tweets arenât artificially amplified. While Dorsey appeared chastened, the idea that it is someone elseâs job to confront the problem is core to the way social media companies look at the ongoing challenges of misinformation and online toxicity. Dorseyâs initial statement betrayed the truth: Powerful companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter increasingly rely on the efforts of others to address the spread of misinformation on their platforms. And itâs not just journalists they hope to conscript into the battle. Consider YouTubeâs announcement earlier this year that it would rely on Wikipedia to address conspiracy theories (the company failed to inform Wikipedia before it made this announcement), or Facebookâs seeming reliance on a loose network of volunteers to spot fake accounts and debunk misinformation its own teams miss.  Issues of misinformation and online toxicity are challenging nations across the globe, and the reality is that these problems are too big for these companies to address. Evidence is piling up on the real world implications. Thatâs why itâs time to think about radical solutions. Hereâs one: Governments should place levies on social media company profits to pay for measures that will address the externalities they produce. This idea is not new. Carbon taxes are a good corollary. Governments across the globe have come to the conclusion that the emission of harmful greenhouse gases can be quantified, and companies producing these harmful emissions should be pay for their remediation. Why not \ treat the externalities created by social media companies as pollution; cleaning up this pollution can and should be paid for by the companies that create it. Such a solution has already been proposed in the United Kingdom, where a parliamentary committee looking at the problems of misinformation suggested levies as a mechanism to expand the function of Britainâs watchdog agency, the Information Commissionerâs Office, and to pay for digital literacy campaigns. Expanding the funding of necessary oversight and programs to help citizens of all ages cope with the overload of information and think critically about the health effects of social media consumption seems fair. After all, these companies have been allowed by democracies to achieve enormous market dominance and systemic importance. Expanding the funding of necessary oversight and programs to help citizens of all ages cope with the overload of information and think critically about the health effects of social media consumption seems fair. What else might such levies fund? Perhaps the social media companies should be required to create trusts that fund a massive injection of capital into journalism. Google has voluntarily committed $300 million to such efforts to some good effect; what would a multiple of that number look like? Itâs a rounding error at one level: Googleâs parent company, Alphabet, saw revenues of $111 billion in 2017. Facebook saw net income of nearly $16 billion in 2017 on revenues of $40 billion. Meanwhile, the combined advertising and circulation revenues of the entire newspaper industry in the United States in 2017 was $27.5 billion, a number that has shrunk precipitously even as the platforms continue to grow. âA strong news industry is also critical to building an informed community,â Mark Zuckerberg wrote last year. âGiving people a voice is not enough without having people dedicated to uncovering new information and analyzing it.â Sounds good â but perhaps democracies ought not rely on Zuckerbergâs limited generosity, and instead put some serious demands on his company. âAddressing these diseconomies of scale- negative externalities borne by users and society as a result of the size of these platforms- represents a priority for technology policy in the 21st century,â Sen. Mark Warner wrote in a recent technology policy paper. These companies cannot address the problems they have created alone â now is the time to think about how to capitalize solutions at scale. Whether we are able to engage with our fellow citizens in a healthy information environment may well determine the fate of our democracy.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple has deemed Facebook-owned app Onavo in violation of its App Store policies and will be giving it the boot shortly. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Apple  spokesperson explained the reasoning behind its decision to pull the app: We work hard to protect user privacy and data security throughout the Apple ecosystem. With the latest update to our guidelines, we made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a userâs device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing and must make it clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used. In some ways, it’s a wonder that Onavo  has lasted this long. Onavo, which Facebook bought back in 2013, does two things. As far as regular consumers are concerned, Onavo comports itself like a VPN, offering to “keep you and your data safe” and “blocking potentially harmful websites and securing your personal information.”  But Onavo’s real utility is pumping a ton of app usage data to its parent company, giving Facebook an invaluable bird’s-eye view into mobile trends by observing which apps are gaining traction and which are fizzling out. That perspective is useful both from a product standpoint, allowing Facebook to get ahead of the competition (Snapchat is a fine example), and giving it an edge for considering which competitors to acquire. That dual personality is likely part of the problem for Apple. In its descriptions, Onavo leans heavily on its promise to “protect your personal information” and the cover story of a fairly legitimate looking VPN. With no meaningful opt-in for users who want to use Onavo’s VPN services but might be hesitant about sharing data with Facebook, the app’s true intentions were buried deep in its description: “Onavo collects your mobile data traffic… Because we’re part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.” By February of this year, the Onavo app had been downloaded more than 33 million times across both iOS and Android. While the app is no longer showing up in searches within Apple’s App Store, it’s still alive and well in Google’s considerably more free-wheeling app store, so Facebook will have to lean more heavily on its Android eyes and ears for now.",0.027,0.853,0.121,0.9886

As an early investor in Xiaomi in spring 2010 and a former board member of the company, I attended Xiaomi’s IPO in Hong Kong on July 9. I felt nostalgic and grateful, and marveled at how much Xiaomi — which seemed like a crazy idea to many back in January 2010 — has achieved over the past eight years. Xiaomi’s business model is not the easiest to appreciate if you have never tried its products. Its holistic value proposition doesnât have an easy equivalent in the US.Â I frequently get asked questions about how the company works and what justifies its valuation for each round over the years. Hereâs my take on the five most asked questions: At first glance Xiaomi may seem like a hardware company, which traditionally has lower gross margins. But if you look at the company as a whole and how it engages with users, itâs much more â itâs an Internet company. It is true that around 70% of Xiaomiâs revenue comes from smartphones, 20% comes from connected devices and lifestyle products, and 10% comes from Internet services in 2017.Â Yet, you can actually think of smartphones as Xiaomi’s customer acquisition tool for its Internet services. Once users get a taste of Xiaomi through its smartphones, they fall in love with the brandâs superb design, ease of usage, quality, and amazing price-to-performance ratio, and are more likely to buy a Xiaomi smart TV next, then Xiaomi’s smart home appliances, and finally use Xiaomiâs apps. Over time, Xiaomi’s Internet service revenue will grow more rapidly than most people think. As of March 2018, Xiaomi already had 38 apps with more than 10 million monthly active users, and 18 apps with more than 50 million monthly active users, including the Mi App Store, Mi Browser, Mi Music, and Mi Video apps.Â Rather than paying search engines to acquire users, Xiaomi is essentially getting paid for acquiring users through selling its smartphones. This allows Xiaomi to have a negative CAC (customer acquisition cost) for its Internet services. Another under-appreciated pillar of Xiaomi’s growth is its “ecosystem strategy.” Xiaomi strategically invests in many startups as well as the many Internet services providers they work with, both in China and outside of China.Â Companies in the Xiaomi ecosystem include SmartMi (air purifiers), Zimi (power banks), Huami (Mi bands), Chun Mi (rice cookers), and 80-plus more. Thanks to these prolific investments, you can find a wide variety of products in any Xiaomi store, from scooters to ukeleles (see below). As a result, every time consumers visit a Xiaomi store, they can find something new, and the frequency of store visits is a lot higher than typical smartphone brands, even Apple.Â   Xiaomi’s users are often loyal to the brand because there are so many great Xiaomi ecosystem products consumers can buy. Over 1.4 million users already own more than five connected Xiaomi products (excluding smartphones and laptops).Â The rising middle class in China and other emerging markets trust, embrace, and identify with the Xiaomi brand â similar to how Muji and Uniqlo from Japan are loved by consumers worldwide. Overtime, as more users become “Mi fans”, Xiaomi’s Internet service revenue will grow, but there is a lagging effect, which many public investors donât fully appreciate yet. In addition, Xiaomi also invests in Internet service providers. It then preloads their content into its own apps, or preloads their apps into its own phones and smart TVs. For example, within the MiÂ Video app, you can access content from top Chinese video platforms likeÂ iQiyi and Youku Tudou, because Xiaomi was an investor in these companies.Â Xiaomi shares advertising and subscription revenue with these platforms, allowing it to rapidly grow its revenue from Internet services, which have extremely high margins.  I have known CEO and founder LEI Jun for almost 10 years. We first met when he became an angel investor in early 2008. When Lei Jun first told me about his idea for Xiaomi in January 2010 in Beijing,Â I listened to his pitch (there wasn’t even a PowerPoint) and it took about 90 minutes before I decided to invest. He used five arguments to convince me. The team he assembled was the only one that had experience in four out of the five areas that I considered to be critical to the success for his âtriathlon modelâ: No one else had all these skills under one roof. This is why I thought Xiaomi might have the chance to do something very special. However, for anyone who passed on Xiaomi early, it was very a reasonable and logical decision.Â In the history of mobile phone companies around the world, no startup had ever been successful. Some even predicted that for Xiaomi to succeed, Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia would all have to fail. In 2010, that seemed a crazy idea. But the rest is history.Â   Xiaomi did a great job in recruiting Hugo Barra, who was formerly an executive at Google Android, to join themÂ as Head of International in 2013. Hugoâs experience lent credibility to Xiaomi, as he became the international face of the company for the next three to four years. He also recruited several young executives and country managers, mostly in their late 20s or early 30s back then, many of whom were first-generation Chinese Americans or Western educated immigrants. These executives have helped Xiaomi become a global company, and they all have a bright future ahead of them with more responsibilities to come. It’s really important to hire the right head of international and country managers to make it work. Conversely, when US companies go to China, it’s harder to hire young millennials to spearhead the China business because the Chinese Internet space is a lot more difficult to navigate. But as there are more and more Gen Z and millennial consumers in China, American and international companies can take more chances, recruit young entrepreneurs to join them, and form an advisory board of industry veterans and investors around their China initiative. In my opinion, the US market is not an immediate priority for Xiaomi today. Emerging markets, which include India, Southeast Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Latin America, represent much bigger and immediate opportunities. Xiaomi is already in 74 countries today. In the first quarter of 2018, over 36% of Xiaomi’s revenue came from markets outside of China.Â According to IDC, in Q4 2017, Xiaomi was among the top five smartphone brands in terms of unit shipments in 15 countries, including India (No. 1), Indonesia (No. 2), Russia, Poland, Greece, and Israel.Â Xiaomi also has plans to double down on markets in Latin America such as Mexico. Why is this significant? Allow me to share a historical lesson. When Yahoo! Invested in Alibaba (another GGV portfolio company) in 2005, the world had 1 billion Internet users. Now, the world has 3.5 billion Internet users. Over the last 13 years, Alibaba’s valuation increased 100 times from $5 billion to $500 billion. The fact that China was the fastest growing market for Internet users during this period, coupled with Alibaba’s amazing ability to execute, turned the company into a growth miracle.Â In the next 12-13 years, the world will most likely grow to 5 billion Internet users. The world’s next 1 billion Internet users that will come online in the next decade – via affordable but high-quality smartphones – are outside of the US. They are in the 74 countries that Xiaomi is already in today.Â Going forward, Xiaomi is very well-positioned to take advantage of the next phase of growth through selling hardware, software, and bundled Internet services, as well as by investing in partner companies in those countries.  I think Xiaomi is undervalued at HK$17 per share. Xiaomiâs was the worldâs largest tech IPO since Alibabaâs in 2014 and it has a relatively complicated business model, so it might take time for public investors to understand and appreciate. I believe Xiaomi will deliver performance that beats expectations going forward. If you look at the IPO price of HK$17 a share, Xiaomi was valued using a revenue multiple of 10x for its Internet services (a discount to Alibaba and Tencent), and 2x for its hardware-related revenue (an average multiple for one of Chinaâs favorite brands), based on the 2017 numbers. So there is still a lot of potential for upside both in terms of operational growth and multiple expansions. I remember when Facebook went public in 2012, its share was priced at $38 and its first day of trading ended at $38.23. Obviously, six years later, Facebook is now worth about five times its valuation at IPO. Similarly, there’s a lot of room for Xiaomi to grow.Â  Iâd like to give a shoutout to other major early investors in Xiaomi, including Richard Liu of Morningside Venture Capital, Tuck Koh of ShunWei Capital, and Yuri Milner, Shou Zi Chew (now Xiaomiâs CFO) of DST Global. Their continued support has been instrumental to Xiaomiâs success.

22,ADAM SATARIANO,"President Trump has increasingly denounced tech companies, as well as the news media, on the grounds that they suppress information favorable to his administration.",2018-08-28 14:41:40,the-new-york-times,Trump Accuses Google of Burying Conservative News in Search Results,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/business/media/google-trump-news-results.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/business/29trumpgoogle-sub/29trumpgoogle-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by By Adam Satariano, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Cecilia Kang President Trump, in a series of early morning Twitter posts on Tuesday, attacked Google for what he claimed was an effort to intentionally suppress conservative news outlets supportive of his administration. Mr. Trumpâs remarks â and an additional warning later in the day that Google, Facebook and Twitter âhave to be carefulâ â escalated a conservative campaign against the internet industry that has become more pointed since Apple, Google and Facebook removed content from Alex Jones, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who runs the site InfoWars and has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump. âGoogle search results for âTrump Newsâ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media,â Mr. Trump said on Twitter at 5:24 a.m. âIn other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent.â Mr. Trump added that âthey are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!â Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and a longtime advocate of deregulation, appeared to back Mr. Trump when asked by reporters later on Tuesday whether the administration would be pursuing more regulation of Google. âWeâll let you know,â Mr. Kudlow said. âWeâre taking a look at it.â In a statement, Google said that its search service was ânot used to set a political agenda and we donât bias our results toward any political ideology.â The presidentâs tweets landed at a difficult moment for the tech industry. There is a growing sense across the political spectrum in the United States and in other countries that something must be done to rein in their influence. Executives from many of the largest internet companies will face questions next week at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about their efforts to prevent foreign meddling in the midterm elections in November, a follow-up to congressional hearings held after the 2016 elections. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebookâs chief operating officer, and Twitterâs Jack Dorsey are scheduled to testify in front of the committee. Google has also been called to testify. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate committee, has asked Google to send Sundar Pichai, its chief executive. So far, the company has offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs. Mr. Burr said he was unlikely to subpoena Mr. Pichai to testify, but that his absence would signal that Google was choosing ânot to participateâ and be âpart of the solution.â Interfering in how companies like Google and Facebook present information would be a notable departure for the federal government, which has mostly taken a hands-off approach to the internet. Free-speech scholars said companies like Google and Facebook were free to operate with few restrictions thanks to a 1996 law called the Telecommunications Act. âThat law pretty much removes free-speech liability for Google and Facebook,â said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the Newhouse School. âThat being said, I think itâd be a major leap to believe that the people behind Google are writing algorithms to discriminate against content.â Last month, regulators in Europe fined Google $5.1 billion for antitrust violations. After the European fine, Mr. Trump said Google was âone of our great companies.â What sort of pressure regulators in the United States could exert is not entirely clear. The Justice Department, under both the Trump and Obama administrations, has shown little interest in pursuing antitrust cases against Google or its parent company, Alphabet. Mr. Trump has often raised antitrust questions about another tech giant, Amazon, but little has come of his threats. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has suggested that if internet companies are not a âneutral platform,â they should not be protected by a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad legal immunity for what people put on their services. Appearing in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a vague expansion of his earlier criticism, saying that social news platforms were actively âtaking advantageâ of people. âWe have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just canât do that,â Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trumpâs claims of bias appeared to be inspired by a segment Monday night from Lou Dobbs, a host on the Fox Business Network. Mr. Dobbs highlighted an article by a conservative website, PJ Media, that said that it had conducted what it called an unscientific study in which 96 percent of Google search results for the word âTrumpâ were articles from âleft-leaning sites.â The piece was also featured on the website Drudge Report, whose operator, Matt Drudge, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. Search engine experts said Google uses many factors in its search algorithm â including how often a web page is linked to by other sites and how often certain words appear on a page â and that formula is constantly being updated. âEvery year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to usersâ queries,â the company said. âWe continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.â Even longtime Google critics disagreed with the premise of the PJ Media article. âThe industry should have plenty of concerns with Google, particularly antitrust and data collection practices, but this isnât one of them,â said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. âThe presidentâs tweets this morning are flat-out absurd.â Long before Facebook, Apple and Google had removed InfoWars from their sites, conservatives were zeroing in on Big Tech as a new enemy in the political culture wars. In February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., guests packed a ballroom for a discussion called âSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.â Although it provided a target for those in attendance, Google was a sponsor of the conference. The company held a reception for conference attendees, with an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace. Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, has followed a similar line of attack as a writer and producer of a new documentary, âThe Creepy Line,â which argues that Silicon Valley is stifling conservative content. The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion website, recently posted the trailer. During the presidential election, Trump campaign officials claimed Google was manipulating search results to favor Hillary Clinton. But right after the election, the top Google search result for âfinal election vote count 2016â was a link to a story that wrongly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, had also defeated Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote. Since then, Google has updated its search algorithm to surface what it calls âmore authoritativeâ news sources. The internet companies find themselves caught between conservatives who say they are being heavy-handed and others who say they are not doing enough to police their sites. Twitter only suspended Mr. Jonesâs account, for example, and was condemned by some of its own employees and many on the left for not being tougher. But the move by other tech giants earlier this month to ban Mr. Jones drew condemnation from a range of conservatives â even some who say they do not care for Mr. Jones. âWho the hell made Facebook the arbiter of political speech?â Mr. Cruz said in a tweet. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, has also raised concerns that Republican voices were being stifled online. He was joined by other Republican House leaders, including Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, who threatened to subpoena Twitterâs chief executive, Jack Dorsey, if he did not testify in Congress in a separate hearing on Sept. 5 on content moderation on the internet. âSocial media platforms are increasingly serving as todayâs town squares,â Mr. McCarthy said in a statement after Mr. Dorsey agreed to testify. âBut sadly, conservatives are too often finding their voices silenced.â Follow Adam Satariano, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @satariano, @daiwaka and @ceciliakang Jeremy Peters, Katie Rogers and Edmund Lee contributed reporting.

23,Louise Matsakis,We're increasingly wary of sharing too much on social media. So why are we still doing it on Venmo?,2018-08-26 11:00:00,wired,Stop Sending Money on Venmo. There Are Better Alternatives,https://www.wired.com/story/venmo-alternatives/,/images/video-fallback/w-fallback-full.png,"Venmo, the popular payment app owned by PayPal, has become the default way millions of Americans settle a check, pay a friend back for coffee, or buy a concert ticket off Craigslist. Writers have argued that Venmoing makes us petty, and that the app has nearly killed cash. Fewer have questioned whether itâs really the best service for exchanging money, or storing sensitive banking information. The app has reigned supreme for over half a decade, but in 2018, there are more secure and easier-to-use payment options worth considering as replacements. Venmoing may be standard, but hereâs why Iâve switched. Most Venmo competitors, like Squareâs Cash app, share the same core feature: You can send money with a few taps and swipes. Venmo is unique in that it has a social networking component. By default, all peer-to-peer Venmo transactionsâaside from the payment amountâare public, to everyone in the world. Venmoâs insistence on mimicking a social networking app isn't just weirdâit can have unnerving consequences. Creepy, right? Venmo does give users the ability to limit who can see transactions both before and after they're sent, but many people donât choose to adjust their privacy settings. When I opened Venmo recently, the first payment on my news feed was from a friend whose concerns about privacy have led him to delete both his Instagram and Facebook accounts. Despite taking drastic steps to limit his digital footprint, I know who he ate sushi with last night, thanks to Venmo. Venmoâs insistence on mimicking a social networking app isn't just weirdâit can have unnerving consequences. In July, privacy advocate and designer Hang Do Thi Duc released Public by Default, a site that taps into Venmoâs API to highlight how much information can be gathered about you from your public activity on the app. She was able to trace the exact spending habits of a couple in California, documenting what stores they shopped at, when they took their dog to the vet, and when they made loan payments. The same month, an engineer created a now-defunct Twitter bot that documented Venmo payments referencing drugs. Three years earlier, two unrelated technologists made a similar site to track supposedly scandalous payments, which is still running. In the past, PayPal has insisted that users can simply change their Venmo settings to opt out of this kind of tracking. But even the Federal Trade Commission has argued that changing your Venmo privacy settings has historically been too onerous. In February, PayPal settled with the regulatory agency over allegations that Venmo âmisled consumers about the extent to which they could keep their transactions private.â (Recently, even PayPal employees have questioned whether all transactions should be public by default, according to a Bloomberg story published earlier this week.) The FTC said Venmo didnât make it clear that users needed to change multiple settings in order to make their transactions truly hidden. The agency said the app also failed to disclose that one party in a transaction could retroactively change the privacy settings the other person set for the exchange. Venmo now includes a privacy tutorial pop-up for all new users, according to a spokesperson for the company. In the same complaint, the FTC also alleged that Venmo, at least until March 2015, âmisrepresented the extent of security it provided to consumer financial accounts,â by claiming that it had âbank-grade security protections.â While Venmo doesnât appear to make such claims on its website anymore, the app isn't a bank, even though we often treat it like one. Venmo won't, for example, typically provide the same level of customer service in the event your money is stolen. Venmo does offer some security protections, like requiring a unique pin be entered to access your account. But again, theyâre not enabled by default. If Venmo were the only cash-transfer app of its kind, then fine. But there are plenty of better options out there. Apple Pay Cash, the iPhone makerâs Venmo-equivalent, requires two-factor authentication on your Apple ID to start making payments. It was also rated the best peer-to-peer payment app by Consumer Reports earlier this month, largely for its robust security protections. One downside: You can only use it to transfer money between Apple devices. If you have an Android device, or simply want a payment app thatâs hardware neutral, Squareâs Cash app works great. The app's interface is sleek and easy to use, and there's no weird newsfeed. Sure, all your friends may be on Venmo, but maybe not for long: Square Cash is quickly growing more popular. The app was downloaded more times than Venmo in July and, as of earlier this week, it ranked higher than Venmo in the Apple App Store in the free finance apps category. For the most part, Square Cash and Venmo share many of the same features. One downside to Square Cash is that it charges a 1.5 percent fee to instantly transfer a payment to your bank account, while Venmo only charges 25 cents. That higher fee can be a pain if you need to move a large amount of money quickly, but neither app charges anything for non-rush bank transfers, which typically occur the next business day. Square Cash also allows you to discover users nearby using Bluetooth, lowering the possibility of sending beer money to the wrong John Smith. If youâd rather not download a new app, both Facebook and Google offer ways to send and receive money through services you may already use, like Gmail and Messenger. Your banking app may also already have the payment transfer service Zelle built into it, which could become more popular than Venmo this year. An additional upside to these services is that you can use many of them from your desktop. Venmo, on the other hand, recently announced plans to disable its web functionality, making it mobile-only. You likely already have several Venmo alternatives waiting for you on your phone. At the very most, youâll need to convince your friends to download Square Cash in order to fully rid yourself of Venmoâs strange news feed. I, for one, already have it installed. The launch of Appleâs iPhone X brought face recognition, animoji, and the notch into the mainstream. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast. All rights reserved.

24,Emily Dreyfuss,"In security news this week, Apple and Facebook beef, Reality Winner gets sentenced, facial recognition at the airport, and more.",2018-08-25 14:43:20,wired,"Reality Winner, Insider Trading, and More Security News This Week",https://www.wired.com/story/delete-onavo-facebook-vpn-app-security-roundup/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b8086a63dca62083fbf4860/191:100/pass/FacebookCreepyApp-831882106.jpg,"The biggest news in America this week struck like two timed missiles minutes apart on Tuesday afternoon. Though they appear at first blush unrelated to Russiaâs hacking of the 2016 US election, they are likely to explode right in the heart of Robert Muellerâs investigation. First. Trumpâs former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to two feloniesâimplicating the president in both crimes in courtâand then Trumpâs former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty of eight criminal charges. Robert Mueller expert Garrett Graff explains what this means for the Russia investigation, and spells out the six biggest questions now facing the administration, Congress, and the American people. WIREDâs latest cover story details the most devastating cyberattack in history. Andy Greenberg spent the better part of a year getting the full story of the NotPetya code, which took down the worldâs cyber infrastructure in 2017. Greenberg reveals previously untold details about the devastation NotPetya caused, particularly at shipping giant Maersk, in breathtaking detail. Of course there was more news in the security world. The Democratic National Committee thought a phishing test was a real attack. Researchers discovered the ultrasonic sound monitors make can reveal whatâs on your screen. We explained how to protect yourself from a SIM swap attack. Facebook and Twitter thwarted suspicious activity coming from Iran, and Microsoft seized six domains owned by Russian hacking group Fancy Bearâboth of which were attempting to influence the midterm elections. With tech companies seemingly on the front lines of defending democracy from foreign aggressors, we wonder, why isnât the government doing more? Should it really be up to Silicon Valley to defend US democracy? Plus, there's more. As always, weâve rounded up all the news we didnât break or cover in depth this week. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. Appleâs been a quest this summer to force all apps in its App Store to conform to stricter privacy rules. Unsurprisingly, Facebookâs so-called security app Onavo failed and was subsequently booted. Onavo is a virtual private network app that lets you access the internet on your phone through a private Facebook server. While that makes it harder for third parties or hackers to spy on your phone activity, it gives Facebook full access to it. Not ideal. And while Facebook removed Onavo from the App Store, if you downloaded it alreadyâor if you have it on Androidâit's still there, logging all your data. You need to delete the app manually. And if youâre still not convinced itâs a bad idea to let Facebook spy on all your phone activity even when it has nothing to do with the social media site, we wrote you this explainer about all Onavoâs problems a few months. Read it, then get deleting. This story is bananas. In possibly the biggest security fraud case in US history, according to law enforcement, stock traders on Wall Street were paying hackers to break into business newswire websites to steal embargoed press releases that would allow the traders to make preemptive stock buys. The Verge this week traced the whole scheme back to three Russian hackers, who were embroiled in a turf war over access to the press release sites. The story is a classic saga of greed, but with a modern twist: with the internet, insider trading becomes a whole new thing. As reporter Isobel Koshiw writes, âTraders no longer need someone inside a company to obtain inside information. Instead, they can turn to hackers, who can take their pick of security weaknesses.â Australia has a lot going for it: weird animals, lots of sun, and great accents. But apparently internet security isnât a strong suit. At least, not in Western Australia, where a recent security audit of government agencies found that more than a quarter of government officials had seriously weak passwords. Five thousand of them has the word âpasswordâ in their password. Luckily, this was revealed by a government-ordered audit, so thereâs time for these officials to process the shame of their poor passwords and come up with something stronger. If they need some tips, they can start here. Only three days after Washingtonâs Dulles Airport switched on its new biometric facial recognition tech, the system caught an imposter trying to enter the US from Brazil on a fake passport. This is the first time this implementation has caught an identity scammer, according to authorities. They said it was likely human passport agents would have allowed the man to enter because he looked much like the picture on the passport. The facial recognition system, however, flagged him. Authorities later found the manâs real ID hidden in his shoe, arrested him, and sent back to Brazil. On Thursday, a US District Court Judge in Georgia sentenced former NSA contractor Reality Winner to 63 months in prison for violating the Federal Espionage Act. Winner had pled guilty earlier this summer to leaking a confidential NSA report on Russian election hacking to the website The Intercept. The Intercept faced criticism after it published an article based on Winnerâs leak, because in the process of reporting it inadvertently clued officials into Winner's identity based on printer marks on the leaked document. If you have no idea what Struts 2 is, you should stop reading, go outside, and enjoy your weekend, hopeful that the people who do know keep reading and update theirs immediately. Threat Post reports that the Apache Software Foundation found a vulnerability in open-source developer framework Struts 2, used for coding in Java, that could be more dangerous than a similar vulnerability that led to the massive Equifax breach last year. âThe vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of untrusted user data in the core of the Struts framework,â Threat Post reports. Apache is urging all developers to update. If you use Struts 2.3, update to 2.3.35. If you use 2.5, update to 2.5.17. Got that? Great. Thanks for updating and keeping us all safe! It seems like every time you turn around there's a new breach of personal information. Follow these steps to minimize the damage. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast. All rights reserved.
