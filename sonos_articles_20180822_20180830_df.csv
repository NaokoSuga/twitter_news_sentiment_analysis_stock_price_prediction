 Choosing the best wireless speakers can be a tricky undertaking. Not only because the design needs to be in-keeping with your home office or studio, but because we all have slightly different requirements when it comes to listening to our favourite tunes. And with hundreds of products vying for your attention, finding the best wireless speakers, which tick all your boxes, can take hours of research.  But don't panic, because here, we've done a lot of the hard work for you and put all the very best wireless speakers together in this handy guide. If you’re looking for a set of wireless speakers that give you all the benefits of fully wireless tech, with no need for a mains connection (albeit using an add-on battery pack), then you need look no further than the Ruark Audio MR1 MK2 (pictured above). Where most Bluetooth speakers are housed in a single unit, here you get the option of a true, stereo set-up, via two separate speakers. And if you’re looking for something higher end for your studio, we’ve opted for the Sonos One, which can be extended out to multiple rooms via wi-fi (and can support a staggering 32 connected–fully synced–speakers). Choosing the best wireless speakers can include a number of factors. If you’re looking for something you can take to the beach, then you’ll want an extended battery life, Bluetooth-support, and a housing that can deal with everything the elements can throw at it. And if you’re looking for the best wireless speakers for your studio, where a required mains connection isn’t a problem, you can invest in a multi-room set-up – but all this comes at a price. Wireless speakers come in many forms, and in this post we span the full range, from budget Bluetooth speakers, to higher-end systems for your studio. Whatever your needs, we’ve got them covered.  This Bluetooth wireless speaker rocks out in full stereo Compatibility: Bluetooth 4.0 | Battery life: Up to 12hrs (requires battery pack) | Dimensions: 170 × 130 × 135mm | Inputs: Optical in, Aux in, Sub out, 3.5mm output The Ruark Audio MR1 MK2 speakers are as close as you’ll get to hi-fi audio in an affordable Bluetooth package (boasting tech usually reserved for higher-end hi-fi kit, such as tuned crossovers and A/B amplification).  All this tech means that these speakers require a mains supply to operate, but Ruark has left no stone unturned, and even provides a portable, power supply – in the shape of the Backpack II – which can be attached to the back of the primary speaker, making it fully wireless, and offering up to 12 hours of playback on a single charge (Backpack II sold separately). Available in walnut or soft grey, there’s a design option to suit those that prefer a more traditional look, or something more Apple-friendly. And since the first version Ruark has also upgraded the grey fabric covering the speakers, which improves both its looks and audio performance. Whereas most Bluetooth speakers come with a limited set of inputs, here you also get the benefit of an optical input that can support hi-res audio up to 24-bit/192kHz. This means that you can run audio from your TV or amp directly into these speakers, providing even more versatility.  If you’re looking for stunning sound and design, look no further Compatibility: Bluetooth, AirPlay, Spotify Connect | Battery life: N/A (requires mains) | Dimensions: 180 x 660 x 190mm | Inputs: USB, Aux in, Ethernet If you know anything about audio, then you know that Bowers & Wilkins has more than 50 years of experience in making speakers that not only perform well, but also look the part (with Sir Kenneth Henry Grange, co-founder at Pentagram, setting the standard for the company’s product design). Given the company’s design heritage, it’s no surprise that the latest iteration of its Zeppelin speaker stands out from the crowd; you’ll either love it, or think it looks like a giant suppository.  Idiosyncratic design apart, the sound of the Zeppelin is amazing. Basically, B&W has thrown every acronym into the mix. You get up-sampling via a 192kHz/24bit DAC (digital-to-analogue) converter, a DSP (digital signal processor) that ensures low and high volumes perform equally well, and B&W’s proprietary FST (fixed suspension transducer) tech, which improves the performance of its midrange drivers. In short, a lot of work has gone into making the Zeppelin sound incredible. Add to this support for Bluetooth, AirPlay and Spotify Connect, and you have a wireless speaker that’s tough to beat, but it doesn’t come cheap.  Too posh to mosh? Don’t write off the Heavy Metal just yet Compatibility: Bluetooth 4.0 | Battery life: up to 8 hours | Dimensions: 63 x 200 x 60mm | Inputs: 3.5mm input The Jam Heavy Metal HX-P920 nails its colours to the mast with its name, and packs a serious punch into 600 grams of pure grunt. For a speaker now priced at under $70/£70, you won’t find a better driver combo, with the Heavy Metal sporting two small active drivers and a pair of passive radiators–the radiators responding to air movement to boost that bass. But make no mistake, this Bluetooth speaker doesn’t simply cater to those about to rock, and does a fantastic job with most genres, with superb high-end frequency performance, too. The Heavy Metal’s simple metallic housing supports two speaker grilles, on the front and rear of the device, and is operated via six metallic buttons on the top of the unit. And pairing couldn’t be easier, despite no support for NFC, with the Heavy Metal establishing a connection to audio sources in seconds (signified by a reassuring series of bongs).  We’ve put this speaker through the wringer over the last year, and a few scuffs aside, it’s retained its looks and performance, and still puts speakers available for a similar price to shame.  The Sonos One combines quality and expandability into a pint-sized powerhouse Compatibility: Wi-Fi | Battery life: N/A (requires mains) | Dimensions: 162 × 119 × 119mm | Inputs: Ethernet The first thing to point out here is that the Sonos One isn’t to be confused with the Sonos Play:1, despite them looking almost identical. Because with the One, you get the long-awaited inclusion of built-in Alexa support. Design-wise, Sonos has always produced speakers that exude under-stated style, and will fit unobtrusively into most homes and studios. And if you should want to control the device physically, touch controls represent pause, play, and volume. But when you’ve got voice control, who needs buttons? To connect services such as Tidal or Spotify you’ll need to use the Sonos controller app, but almost everything else can be controlled by your voice. And thanks to the Sonos using Wi-Fi rather than Bluetooth to connect, you can sync up to 32 speakers, over a much longer range. Thanks to Sonos syncing tech, you can either have a single sound source playing seamlessly over multiple speakers, or create multiple smaller groups. This makes the Sonos One perfect for a studio environment, where you might want the same music playing from all your speakers, or have smaller groups for different floors/spaces/rooms etc.  Can a soundbar seriously take on your hi-fi? Yes. Yes it can Compatibility: Wi-fi, Two-way Bluetooth 4.0 | Battery life: N/A (requires mains) | Dimensions: 78 × 1060 × 130mm | Inputs: 4K/HDR HDMI, optical audio input, 3.5mm audio port Samsung is making some serious leaps in audio development, not least in its soundbar technology. And whilst you may not use its award-winning Samsung HW-MS650 Soundbar in wireless mode with your TV (because we suspect you’ll want it fairly close to your television), you can still use it as a wireless source for other audio inputs. Thee MS650 can stream from both Bluetooth devices and via Samsung’s multi-room app, which supports music services such as Spotify, Tidal and Amazon Music. And if you want to go a step further, you can include Samsung’s 9000S speakers to go for full-on surround sound. The tech that Samsung has packed into its soundbar is astonishing, with left, right, and centre channels comprising six woofers and three tweeters, all powered by 20W amps. For most people, this will handle all your TV and hi-fi needs in one package, and all for a price that won’t break the bank.  This Bluetooth speaker excels; and it charges stuff too! Compatibility: Bluetooth 3.0, NFC | Battery life: up to 20 hours | Dimensions: H170 × W130 × D135mm | Inputs: 3.5mm Aux in, USB Weighing in at 780 gramms, you’re not going to be slipping the JBL Charge 3 into your pocket, but if you can handle the heft, there’s a lot to love about this Bluetooth behemoth. First up, it’s waterproof. And we’re not talking splash-me-with-a-wet-lettuce waterproof either; the Charge 3 has an IPX7 rating, which means you can dunk it in a swimming pool for up to 30 minutes.  With the added weight of the Charge 3 comes 20 hours of playback, and the ability to charge other USB devices via its 6,000mAh battery, such as your iPhone, which will be a killer feature for anyone away from a mains connection for any length of time. And if you’re looking for a speaker for the beach or the pool that provides decent audio (for everything but the highest frequencies), and don’t mind the extra weight, then the JBL Charge 3 won’t let you down.

The Sonos Beam with built-in voice capabilities was released recently. Then Sonos rolled out compatibility with AirPlay 2 for some of its speakers. Now the company has announced the Sonos Amp. The $599 Sonos Amp is a replacement for the Sonos Connect: Amp, but it is much more than a mere replacement.  I love the Sonos system I have in our living room. It gives us great surround sound from our TV and, when not used with the television, does a great job of filling the main living area with sound. I even have it connected to our Amazon Alexa ecosystem so we can get the music going by voice. Still, I have a host of great speakers in our other rooms which, sadly, canât work with the Sonos system. With the new Sonos Amp, they can.  The Sonos Amp is: â¦a powerful and versatile home audio hub that powers traditional wired speakers with sound from nearly any source, and fully integrates these speakers into Sonosâ easy to use wireless home sound system.  I mentioned the Sonos Amp is a replacement for the Sonos Connect: Amp. On one level it is, but it is more than a 2018/2019 update. The Sonos Amp is twice as powerful as the Connect:Amp. It supports Appleâs AirPlay 2 and, of course, works with more than 100 different streaming services. For those looking to connect speakers and the Sonos Amp to their media system, the Sonos Amp includes an HDMI Arc port. When the Amp is wirelessly connected to an Amazon Alexa-enabled device like a Sonos One or Beam, it can be controlled with voice commands and, like other Sonos devices, Amp will see frequent, free over-the-air updates so it can gain new features, services, and integrations over time. Finally, Amp is powerful. It can power up to four speakers with 125 watts per channel.    Sonos Amp Specifics:  The new Sonos Amp looks amazing and extends Sonosâ recent series of announcements. The new hardware is impressive and, because Sonos has shown it is committed to supporting legacy hardware as much as it does their new products, it promises to make your Sonos-enabled home even better. Donât have a Sonos-enabled home? You might want to consider getting started. Trust me, youâll love it. Learn more about the Sonos Amp and all the Sonos products here.

 Regardless of whether youâre a gamer, podcaster, or just dong voice-overs, the one thing you need to have is a really good microphone. While you can probably find a cheap microphone to get by with for a while, we’re sure you’ve also looked at microphones from Blue.

 Googleâs big, premium Apple HomePod rival the Home Max is finally being released in the UK today, bringing Google Assistant to the high-end smart speaker market. Announced in October 2017 and on sale in the US since November, the Home Max joins Googleâs smaller Home and smallest Home Mini smart speakers as the big one. Google Assistant sorts voice commands, controls and questions exactly the same as Googleâs smaller smart speaker offerings, but the way it sounds couldnât be more different. The Home Max is relatively large box speaker, by smart speaker standards, with a white or black smooth plastic body and grey or charcoal coloured fabric front. In white and grey itâs simple fabric front and rounded corners make the Home Max look a bit bland up next to a Sonos Play:5 or an Apple HomePod, but it might be easier to blend in with soft home furnishings. It is about the size of a large bookcase speaker, but weighs over 5kg. White dots in the centre of the fabric front show when the Home Max is actively listening to you, when itâs working on a query or speaking to you, or shows the volume level when you adjust it. It can be stood up vertically or placed horizontally with a little rubber foot that attaches to the bottom magnetically. When horizontal the hidden touch strip on top acts as a pause-play button and a volume slider, both of which work well. A mute switch on the back allows you to turn off the microphones if you would like a little privacy from Google Assistantâs listening out for its wake words, which are either âHey Googleâ or the older âOkay, Googleâ. When the mute switch is flicked the dots light up red until you turn the mics back on. An analogue 3.5mm line-in socket and USB-C port round out the back, alongside the figure-of-eight power cable. Thereâs also Bluetooth for streaming your music directly from a phone, tablet or computer if you need to. Setting up the Home Max is super easy, but requires an Android or iOS device. Just plug it in, open the Google Home app on your smartphone or tablet, tap the button to set up a new device and follow the instructions. It took about five minutes to get the speaker out of the box and playing music. Google Assistant is the same on the Home Max as it is on any other Google Home smart speaker. Since the original Home launched in May 2017, Assistant has become smarter answering more and more questions, and is impressively able to not only recognise the words youâre saying but also what youâre trying to say â when you butcher a question, Assistant will still be able to work out what you want, more often than not. Assistant also has the ability to recognise individual voices using Googleâs Voice Match â a feature still not available for Amazonâs Alexa in the UK â so when you ask for an update on your calendar or music from your library you get your stuff, rather than stuff belonging to someone else who lives in your house. Google has also continually added to Assistants smart home device control, which now rivals Amazonâs Alexa in most categories. But it is Assistantâs ability to control a wider range of music services, including Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube Music and Deezer â combined with the best voice recognition â which has made it the one to beat. The Home Max certainly produces a big, aggressive sound and is loud enough as a single unit to fill even large rooms. Itâs front-facing two 4.5in woofers and two tweeters produce fairly direct sound, making the Home Max a speaker to put at the end of a room rather than in the middle of it like Appleâs HomePod or the cheaper Amazon Echo. It doesnât really have a sweet spot, however, sounding pretty uniform no matter where you sit in front of it. It has an intelligent audio tweaking system called Smart Sound, which uses the mics and AI to adjust the music as you play to a account for location, noise sources, track and even the time of day. Appleâs HomePod has a similar system built in, but Sonosâs Play:5 and others require an iPhone or iPad to tune the speakers each time you move them. The Home Max sounds punchy, producing music with lots of attack in the mids and deep bass. If you like big booming bass, you will love the Home Max, but I found the bass a bit loose in some tracks, missing some subtlety â turning the bass down in the equaliser helped a little. Rap tracks such as Dr Dreâs Still DRE, Forgot About Dre or The Next Episode sounded really aggressive and great. Jazz tracks such as Moaninâ by Art Blakey sounded warm and punchy, and it even did a fairly good job with Holstâs Jupiter performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It seemed most at home with pop tracks such as In My Feelings by Drake or Anywhere by Rita Ora. But playing tracks such as Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys, where the intro drum beats lost a bit of their alternating rhythm, or a live version of Hotel California by the Eagles, which lost clarity and separation between individual notes and vocals, showed the Home Maxâs weakness. It has a big, powerful sound, but it lacks the sparkle and subtlety something like the Sonos Play:5 or Appleâs HomePod brings, which allows you to discover new parts of your favourite tracks you might not have been able to hear before. The Smart Sound tuning improves over time, and I found that the sound was a little more room dependent than others, sounding better in the longer, more open kitchen than the living room. Volume consistency between tracks on Spotify was also weak, with some tracks drastically louder than the previous. Dynamic range is great, but feeling like you have to jockey the volume between tracks isnât. I also found thedirect, aggressive nature of the sound a little wearing over extended listening sessions compared to some more immersive rivals. The Home Max can also play in multi-room audio groups with other Google Home or Chromecast devices, which makes filling your whole house with the same music easy. Stereo pairing is also available, but I did not have two to test. The dots in the middle switch orientation when you turn the speaker between vertical or horizontal You can charge your phone from the USB-C port (but not quickly) Volume controlled via the buttons on your phone in the Google Home app adjust the volume by between 4 and 6%, which is strange Assistant will tell you if youâve placed the Home Max upside down â it will still work though Thereâs a good level of granularity in the volume control, meaning you can easily get the volume just right The Google Home Max costs Â£399 and comes in two colours: chalk or charcoal. For comparison, the Google Home costs Â£99, the Home Mini costs Â£39. Appleâs HomePod costs Â£319, the Sonos One costs Â£199 and the Sonos Play:5 costs Â£499. The Google Home Max is one big sound upgrade for Google Assistant, producing powerful, room-filling sound and booming bass. While Google Assistant is the best voice assistant available right now, with the widest range of music services and most capable voice recognition and understanding, the Home Max doesnât quite match the exquisite audio produced by the likes of the Apple HomePod or Sonos Play:5. If you want a speaker to blast out music at a party or in the kitchen, the Home Max is brilliant. If you want a top-end living room listening experience to replace a great hi-fi, then at Â£400 this isnât quite there yet. Pros: Google Assistant is great, multi orientation, loud and punchy, can always hear you, Bluetooth and analogue in, native Spotify and multiple other music services, adaptive sound, granular volume control via percentage, good touch controls Cons: variable volume in playlists, not much good for a non-Google user, smart speaker privacy concerns, better for some music genres than others, expensive Google Home review: the smart speaker that answers almost any question Google Home Mini review: a brilliant little voice assistant speaker Apple HomePod review: Siri lets down best sounding smart speaker Sonos Play:5 review: one of the best wireless speakers money can buy Amazon Echo second-generation review: smaller, cheaper and better",0.021,0.814,0.165,0.9997

 Google Home Max offers maximum sound, but it also has a maxed-out size and price tag. If you're tied to Google's ecosystem (not Amazon Alexa) and want premium sound, however, then it's a potentially perfect fit. Google has a difficult task: it needs to steal your attention - or rather, your ears and voice - from the competition, as the world of smart home and voice-controlled tech products continues to hot up. These days it's not just Amazon with its Echo line - which features Amazon Alexa, the best-known voice assistant - but also Apple, Microsoft, and a number of other players with their own systems. There are a tonne of smart speakers available now, all at various price points and with differing degrees of features, so it's up to you to navigate through them all and figure out which one is the ideal match. Do you want to spend the least amount possible? Have the widest range of connected features? Or is price no object and you want the most premium sound? Do you care more about fancy features like a touchscreen display? Well, if price isn't a thing and you're mostly concerned about audio quality, consider the Google Home Max speaker. It's basically the same thing as Google Home and Google Home Mini, only it's physically massive and packs a far bigger sound. It's called Max for a reason. It weighs nearly 5.3kgs and looks almost comically large, especially when sat next to the Google Home or Google Home Mini. Its considerable footprint lets you know it's a proper speaker. If we had to compare it to another premium speaker on the market, we'd say it's close in size to the flagship Sonos Play:5. The front grille is cloaked in an 'acoustically transparent fabric', which is the same soft-touch material on the Google Home Mini, available in either chalk or charcoal minimalist grey finishes. The rest of this rounded, rectangular beast has a polycarbonate housing with a smooth silicone base. Unfortunately, Home Max lacks any wall-mount or floor-standing abilities. So, you'll have to put this speaker on a flat shelf, bookcase, TV stand or wherever else you fancy. Luckily, the detachable power cable is long enough to cater for various locations without issue. We recommend moving it around to see where it fits best. Due to it's large size, it'll be hard to find a great spot for Home Max in a typical living room - unless you have one of those extra large, fancy ones. However, thanks to a magnetic, rubbery pad - which helps to reduce vibrations - you can place the Max either vertically or horizontally. Google promises Max has a ""carefully crafted shape and sensor"" for either orientation, although you'll only get stereo sound in horizontal orientation. That's right, turn it vertically and it will switch over to mono. There's an orientation sensor on the inside that does this all automatically - we even discovered while taking pictures of Home Max that if you place the speaker upside down, it'll promptly tell you. Cool. When you unbox Google Home Max, simply plug it into the wall and then wait for it to play a chime to say that it's ready. While it's doing that, download and open the Google Home app, then sign-in with your Google account and select the Devices icon in the top right corner. You'll see Google Home Max at the top of the menu. Tap on Set Up and follow the on-screen prompts that will walk you through connecting the smart speaker to your local Wi-Fi network. You'll have to specify where Home Max will be placed within your house, then setup Google Assistant and connect it to your services. There's a capacitive touch strip on the top of Home Max (well, when it's horizontal). You can slide a finger across it to adjust volume or tap it to pause playback. It works similarly to the touch ring on Google Home. If you don't want to use your finger, you can always use ""OK Google"" or ""Hey Google"" voice commands, or you can use the Google Home app. There are six far-field microphones for picking up voice commands, ensuring voice pick-up in various environments, including when sound or music is eminating from the speaker. On the back of Max there's a switch to disable the microphones, should you wish. There's also a USB-C port, which you can use with an Ethernet adapter for wired networking, plus a 3.5mm input jack to hook it up to other audio sources, giving plenty of options - more than in other Home products. Part of the reason Max is so large is because it packs four drivers - that's two 4.5-inch/114mm high-excursion dual voice-coil woofers and two 0.7 inch/18mm custom tweeters, audio geeks - and six Class-D amplifiers. The result? Home Max is super loud; if it's downstairs and you're upstairs you'll still have no problem jamming out. It's also powerful enough for a party and remains clear even at 100 per cent volume. We're no lab-based audiophiles, so we can't give you detailed graphs about whether the highs are too sharp and the bass too loose (although it's a little bit lacking), but in our real-world tests this speaker has blown our minds - especially as the only other speakers in our house are the first-gen Amazon Echo, Echo Show, and Google Home, which all sound paltry by comparison. Part of Max's impressive sound is due to Smart Sound, a nifty feature that enables the speaker to automatically tune itself to its surroundings using machine learning. Google says it can adjust the equaliser settings to match the acoustics of your room for the most balanced sound - which might sound like nonsense, but Sonos has been delivering this with Trueplay for some time and it really works. What's even better is that two Home Max speakers can be paired for a dual-speaker stereo configuration. Google just recommends you place them 3m/10ft. So, if you want an even more massive sound, that's available. It can get kind of pricey, though, given its Â£399 per speaker, but the Google Home app enables Home Max to be grouped with other Cast-enabled speakers for multi-room audio if that's more suitable. Home Max lets you stream tunes over Wi-Fi from compatible apps on your phone or laptop, and play songs over Bluetooth from your mobile device. You can also plug it into your record player using an AUX stereo cable. Home Max is a standard Cast speaker, so it supports Google's Cast protocol and will work with several compatible services. Go here for a full list of compatible apps and services, but some of the more popular ones include YouTube, Google Play Music, Spotify, and Pandora. Unfortunately, it doesn't stream from Apple Music - though, as we said, you could always stream to the speaker over Bluetooth or plug it into an older iPhone through the 3.5mm jack on the back. Home Max has six far-field microphones so that it can hear your voice commands from across the room... in theory. Like most other smart speakers, this works fine in certain situations. For instance, if the house is quiet, it'll hear you. If a couple people are talking nearby, it'll still hear you. But if it's playing at higher volumes, forget about it. You'll need to scream at the thing to get it to notice you. And, more often that not, that won't even work. You'll physically have to walk over and touch the strip to turn down the volume. Also, we tried putting the Home Max next to our 65-inch 4K LG TV, but, for some reason, it couldn't hear us at all if the TV was on and outputting any sound. Google Assistant on Home Max works just like Assistant on Home and Home Mini. You can use it to play music, ask Google questions, control smart home devices, connect to other Google Home devices (like Chromecast and Chromecast Audio), and more. We mostly use Assistant on Home Max to play YouTube videos on our 4K TV (via Chromecast Ultra), turn our basement heater on or off (via the TP Link smart outlet), and get updates about the weather and news. Assistant is very much like Amazon's Alexa, but it's much better at contextual conversational commands and finding info on the web. Google Home Max offers maximum sound, but it also has a maxed-out size and price tag. If you're tied to Google's ecosystem and want premium sound then it's a potentially perfect fit. But can Google really demand Sonos-level pricing on its first large-scale outing? It sounds good, sure, but we think it would need to undercut on the price front to be a true rush-out-and-buy-it-now speaker. At just Â£30 more, the Sonos has the more sophisticated design and maxes out on the bass too. Google Home can't quite compete, even if it offers up a smarter voice assistant prospect.",0.028,0.829,0.143,0.9996

 If you care about audio quality and want a smart device, Google's Home Max competes with offerings from Sonos and Bang & Olufsen 
By
Matt Burgess
 Google's high-end speaker with built-in voice assistant, designed to compete with Sonos and Bang & Olufsen, is finally coming to the UK. The Google Home Max â a wireless, sleek, device â was first announced all the way back in October last year and has already launched in the US, Canada and Australia. From today it's finally on sale in the UK.  The Home Max is Google's third smart speaker, following the Google Home and Home Mini, and makes a lasting first impression: it's a large, heavy speaker that's been created for audio fans. Overall, it weighs in at 5.3kg and is a little larger than a shoe box. As with all of the firm's smart speakers, the Max has Google Assistant built in. The Assistant is Google's answer to Amazon's Alexa, activated by uttering the company's name, and is also baked into Android phones and available as an app.  When it comes to sound quality, the Max doesn't disappoint. Mark Spates, Google's product lead for smart speakers, says unlike Google's other smart home products the Max has been designed with music as a core use case. The Home Max is packed with two tweeters (0.7in) and two dual voice-coil woofers (4.5in).  It probably won't please diehard audiophiles, but it's still a high-quality speaker that offers a premium sound. The Max is capable of producing deep and clear music playback from Spotify, Google Play and other streaming services. A 3.5mm audio jack on the back of the Max also allows for external inputs. One clear bonus is that it's loud. There probably aren't many occasions when you'll need to hit peak volume, but if you do, the option is always there to disturb the neighbours.

 The Max's design is best described as plain but deliberate. There's no obvious Google logo on the device â there's a tiny G hidden away on the back â and the two inoffensive grey colour options mean that despite its heft the speaker will be able to blend into most homes. It almost gets the industrial design right, but is slightly too bulky. The Max's size and weight put it more in the category of a piece of furniture rather than a unobtrusive speaker, and that means you're not going to move its around your home on a regular basis.  Instead of sticking small rubber feet onto the sides of the Max, ruining the aesthetic with unused feet on display on show, Google includes a magnetic rubber pad with the speaker. This can be stuck on any side of its casing, allowing the speaker to be placed horizontally or vertically. At the moment the Max can't pair with any other speakers made by Google's competitors, but if you're willing to buy two they can be synced to provide (very loud) a stereo system.  Google has included touch controls along one side of the speaker: these allow the volume to be adjusted by swiping a finger along the length of the casing. A tap will pause music. Cleverly, the controls adapt to whether the speaker is sat in a horizontal or vertical position. If you balance it on the wrong edge, Google Assistant will prompt you to rotate the speaker.  At Â£399, the Max isn't cheap. If the Max was purely a speaker its biggest competition would come from the Sonos Play:5, but of those devices with added smarts the nearest rival is the Sonos One. The One is on sale at Â£199 and the firm bundles two together for a price cheaper than the Max. Days before the Max was put on sale in the UK more competition emerged. Harman Kardon, which is owned by Samsung, revealed its disastrously named $700 Citation 500 speaker that's remarkably similar to Google's offering.

 Google hopes its focus on machine learning and AI has been successfully translated to the Max. It's included tech dubbed Smart Sound. The system uses the six inbuilt microphones â that detect when you say ""Okay Google"" â to readjust sound levels based on where in a room you place your speaker. When I placed it next to a wall, the bass was reduced compared to when it was sat in the middle of a space. The feature is smart but alone it doesn't make the device a must buy.  Setting-up the Max is straightforward. It requires the Google Home app and having your phone connected to a local Wi-Fi network. A few taps through the app to select the speaker and it is done. The process takes less than five minutes and should be the benchmark that the setup of all smart home products are held against.  While the Max is able to compete with the audio quality of smart speakers created specifically by audio companies, it outshines them when it comes to the use of voice tech. It probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the software Google created works the best on Google's own products. Anecdotally, the microphones pickup Google Assistant's wake-word more consistently and accurately than the hardware of competitors in the space.  The mics are incredibly sensitive and won't miss you saying the wake words when you're blasting out Spotify. As the Max hears you speak, and when it responds, four LED lights hidden under the speaker's fabric cover turn on. When it comes to the Google Assistant, there's no differences in how it functions: it is the same across all devices it is used in. You can still ask it to read the news, provide calendar updates, set timers and play music. These experiences are better if you're using an Android phone as the Assistant on handsets already has your data and knows you.    Overall, the Google Home Max is one of the best smart speakers that you can buy if you're looking for quality audio. It faces tough competition from Sonos's lineup, but offers a quality audio experience nonetheless. However, the Home Max won't be worth your money if you're not fussy about sound experiences. If you're just in the market for a smart speaker or speaker without any AI assistant, there are other options out there at a better price. Looking for other speakers?

Amp (pictured above) is a $999 product that’s designed to bring audio from practically any source you can throw at it into your Sonos multi-room audio ecosystem. It’s Sonos’ second shot at such a device, and they say that Amp is twice as powerful as its predecessor, Connect:Amp (it certainly has an easier name). It’s got AirPlay 2 support and can also connect to your TV for control via HDMI ARC (similar to how the recently-released Sonos Beam can exert its authority over your TV). It can put music from your Sonos system(s) onto other, non-Sonos speakers throughout your home and it can thus absolutely power your home theatre. Sonos’ other major overnight announcement was an enhancement to its platform for developers. The Sonos Sound Platform will evolve some new control APIs that will allow partners to control Sonos systems to make it easier to integrate them into your smart home. The company hasn’t said much about its forthcoming Google Assistant integration lately, and we wonder whether the new developer APIs might form some of the groundwork for this. Finally, a partnership with Sonance was announced that – besides being a great fit in terms of similarity of company names – will see some new products for in-wall, in-ceiling and outdoor speakers come to market in early 2019. These probably won’t mean much to consumers, but if you’re building a commercial space with integrated speakers, the ability to connect them with a Sonos controller would be a huge boon. The new developer API will be first to hit, with developer.sonos.com saying it’ll open up from September 6. We can expect to see the new Amp come to the local market soon after its global launch in February 2019.

[ Continue reading this over at RedmondPie.com ]",2018-08-30 00:35:55,,Sonos Announces New Speaker Amp With AirPlay 2 Support,https://www.redmondpie.com/sonos-announces-new-speaker-amp-with-airplay-2-support/,https://cdn.redmondpie.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sonos_Amp_System_main.jpg,"Sonos continues to do battle with the competition like Apple’s HomePod and has recently added support for AirPlay 2 to all of its most recent speaker releases, which is great news. Today the company also debuted a new piece of hardware, an updated Sonos Amp, which too will support AirPlay 2 when it goes on sale in December, at least to professional installers. The Sonos Amp is around twice as powerful as the Connect:Amp that it will replace, meaning it will be capable of driving bigger and better speakers without a degradation in audio quality. There is also a raft of changes on the hardware front with the new Sonos Amp featuring not one, but two Ethernet ports as well as support for HDMI ARC for those televisions that support it. This being Sonos, there will also be support for over 100 different sources of streaming audio out of the box.  While all of this sounds great and anyone will be able to buy a Sonos Amp eventually, the staggered release dates – December for installers, February 2019 for the rest of us and costing $599 regardless – should give some sort of indication as to the target market for this thing. High-end installations are where the Sonos Amp will likely live, with support for line-in for fancy audio setups, including turntables, giving installers a way to get any audio into the Sonos ecosystem. That will also mean that when connected to speakers, whether indoors or outdoors, users will be able to take their plastic disc music with them. On top of all of this, Sonos also announced that it will be making some new APIs available to developers. This again ties in with the plan to make the Sonos Amp part of professional installations, allowing developers to make it a central part of integrated smart homes via the use of those new APIs.

I visited the Sonos headquarters in Boston, MA, earlier in the month for an in-depth, first-look at Amp as well as insight into Sonos's strategy to provide more custom integration-friendly product designs along with continuing (free, by the way) updates to the Sonos software platform to make it easier for installers to incorporate Amp into a wider variety of existing and new systems. Explaining this new focus on integration, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said, âThe growth of the Sonic Internetâthe convergence of paid streaming, the smart home, and artificial intelligence through voice technologies drives everything we do at Sonos. While plug-and-play options like Sonos Beam and Sonos One are an important part of the equation, architectural sound and making it even easier to integrate with lighting and home control are equally as important. Weâve listened to custom installers and dealers to create Amp, a versatile product designed to be at the center of the smart home sound experience.â

As a bow in their direction, Amp will be available to professional installers in the US and Canada starting December 1, 2018. The Amp won't launch globally until February 2019. The Amp will also be available for purchase by consumers directly from Sonos for $599.



For those familiar with the old-school, Apple-inspired exterior of the CONNECT:AMP, the striking physical appearance of the Amp's chassis will be a surpriseâand I think it's a pleasant surprise, too. The dimensions (WDH, in inches: 8.54 x 8.54 x 2.52) were engineered, in part, to make the Amp easier to install into AV component racks (two per shelf). Whereas the controls for nearly all of the other Sonos speaker systems are located on the ""top"" of the cabinet, the touch controls for volume up/down, previous/next track (music only), and play/pauseâas well the dimmable LED status indicatorâare located on the smooth front panel of the Amp. When it becomes available to installers in December, the Amp will be available in matte-black finish only.

I found the Amp to look sleek and sophisticatedâyou've got to love the inlaid circle that covers the air vents on the topâbut, for a tech nerd like me, the insides of the Amp are an engineering marvel. It's hard to believe Sonos was able to physically fit all of the components inside that small of a chassis. It's even harder to believe the performance of this condensed mass of electronicsâa 125-watt/channel Class-D amplifier, an AV preamp with HDMI ARC, Wi-Fi, 2 ethernet ports, an auto-detecting subwoofer output with a 50-to-100Hz adjustable crossover, and all the computing power to handle the streaming connectivity and system control. In addition to the physical, however, is the physics: how in the heck do you cram that much inside such a small space without having tons of problems with electromagnetic interference?



We got the chance to step inside the RF testing enclosure (no tests were going on, fortunately), and see a bit of the research that goes into the Sonos secret sauce that makes the company's hardware perform so well. We were also allowed, under strict supervision lest we step on a cable or other crucial part, to wander inside the huge anechoic chamber where Sonos's acoustic engineers do all their acoustic measurements. (They have a smaller one, too, although we didn't get to see it.) I've been in my fair share of anechoic chambers, and this one is one of the largest I've walked into. It also included a proprietary, curved, multi-microphone array, of which the engineers were justifiably proud.



The most important part of my visit to Sonos HQ in Boston, however, was when we were able to listen to an Amp hooked up to a pair of B&W; tower speakers in an average living room-style space. Regardless of the source material, the performance was fantastic; and you'd be hard pressed to find another integrated amp that sounds significantly better for under $600. By adding a rear pair of Sonos wireless speakers (I think they used a pair of Sonos PLAY:1s in the demo) or a second Amp with passive speakersâplus a subwooferâyou can create a (mostly) wireless 4.1-channel surround system. During the movie demos, two things surprised me. First, unless you were way off to the side, you couldn't tell the system lacked a dedicated center channel speaker. Second, the seamlessness of the surround effects with the front soundstage was remarkable.



By the way, Sonos included an HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) port in the Amp in order to make it super-easy to use as a standalone TV speaker upgrade that can operate independently or as part of a larger whole-house Sonos speaker system.

Other announcements from Sonos included the formation of a new partnership with Sonance, in which the two companies will jointly design a line of architectural speakers specifically for use with the Sonos Amp. The advantage of this partnership is that, since Sonos will have all of the speakers parameters, installers will be able to use the company's Trueplay acoustic room tuning capabilities on rooms using the Sonos Amp with the new Sonos/Sonance speakers. No info was available regarding pricing. Availability is expected ""sometime next year.""

Another announcement dealt directly with developers and integrators and covered the company's developer platform and Control APIs: 


Starting in early September, Sonos will further evolve the developer platform by fully opening up to all potential partners and will also add a new set of Control APIs, making it easier than ever to integrate Sonos into the smart home.

The platform will continue to expand with new APIs that allow partners to innovate on their integrations with Sonos. New Control APIs and features make the experience better for customers, especially those with integrated control systems, such as Control4 and Crestron.

These include:
â¢ Line-in switching (for both analog and home theater), to allow for line-in components to be selected within the third-party control interface

â¢ Volume pass-through for easier and more predictable volume control

â¢ The ability to add Sonos playlists within a third-party interface

â¢ In an early preview phase, capabilities to provide notifications and alerts from third-party devices, like a doorbell, through Sonos speakers. Sonos will invite partners to get certified and earn the âWorks with Sonosâ badge. The badge will signal to Sonos owners that companies building and innovating on our platform deliver experiences that meet the Sonos high bar for quality. For those interested in building on the Sonos platform, check out the developer portal.


No doubt we'll be getting a Sonos Amp review unit as soon as they're available. Stay tuned.

For those familiar with the old-school, Apple-inspired exterior of the CONNECT:AMP, the striking physical appearance of the Amp's chassis will be a surpriseâand I think it's a pleasant surprise, too. The dimensions (WDH, in inches: 8.54 x 8.54 x 2.52) were engineered, in part, to make the Amp easier to install into AV component racks (two per shelf). Whereas the controls for nearly all of the other Sonos speaker systems are located on the ""top"" of the cabinet, the touch controls for volume up/down, previous/next track (music only), and play/pauseâas well the dimmable LED status indicatorâare located on the smooth front panel of the Amp. When it becomes available to installers in December, the Amp will be available in matte-black finish only.

I found the Amp to look sleek and sophisticatedâyou've got to love the inlaid circle that covers the air vents on the topâbut, for a tech nerd like me, the insides of the Amp are an engineering marvel. It's hard to believe Sonos was able to physically fit all of the components inside that small of a chassis. It's even harder to believe the performance of this condensed mass of electronicsâa 125-watt/channel Class-D amplifier, an AV preamp with HDMI ARC, Wi-Fi, 2 ethernet ports, an auto-detecting subwoofer output with a 50-to-100Hz adjustable crossover, and all the computing power to handle the streaming connectivity and system control. In addition to the physical, however, is the physics: how in the heck do you cram that much inside such a small space without having tons of problems with electromagnetic interference?



We got the chance to step inside the RF testing enclosure (no tests were going on, fortunately), and see a bit of the research that goes into the Sonos secret sauce that makes the company's hardware perform so well. We were also allowed, under strict supervision lest we step on a cable or other crucial part, to wander inside the huge anechoic chamber where Sonos's acoustic engineers do all their acoustic measurements. (They have a smaller one, too, although we didn't get to see it.) I've been in my fair share of anechoic chambers, and this one is one of the largest I've walked into. It also included a proprietary, curved, multi-microphone array, of which the engineers were justifiably proud.



The most important part of my visit to Sonos HQ in Boston, however, was when we were able to listen to an Amp hooked up to a pair of B&W; tower speakers in an average living room-style space. Regardless of the source material, the performance was fantastic; and you'd be hard pressed to find another integrated amp that sounds significantly better for under $600. By adding a rear pair of Sonos wireless speakers (I think they used a pair of Sonos PLAY:1s in the demo) or a second Amp with passive speakersâplus a subwooferâyou can create a (mostly) wireless 4.1-channel surround system. During the movie demos, two things surprised me. First, unless you were way off to the side, you couldn't tell the system lacked a dedicated center channel speaker. Second, the seamlessness of the surround effects with the front soundstage was remarkable.



By the way, Sonos included an HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) port in the Amp in order to make it super-easy to use as a standalone TV speaker upgrade that can operate independently or as part of a larger whole-house Sonos speaker system.

Other announcements from Sonos included the formation of a new partnership with Sonance, in which the two companies will jointly design a line of architectural speakers specifically for use with the Sonos Amp. The advantage of this partnership is that, since Sonos will have all of the speakers parameters, installers will be able to use the company's Trueplay acoustic room tuning capabilities on rooms using the Sonos Amp with the new Sonos/Sonance speakers. No info was available regarding pricing. Availability is expected ""sometime next year.""

Another announcement dealt directly with developers and integrators and covered the company's developer platform and Control APIs: 


Starting in early September, Sonos will further evolve the developer platform by fully opening up to all potential partners and will also add a new set of Control APIs, making it easier than ever to integrate Sonos into the smart home.

The platform will continue to expand with new APIs that allow partners to innovate on their integrations with Sonos. New Control APIs and features make the experience better for customers, especially those with integrated control systems, such as Control4 and Crestron.

These include:
â¢ Line-in switching (for both analog and home theater), to allow for line-in components to be selected within the third-party control interface

â¢ Volume pass-through for easier and more predictable volume control

â¢ The ability to add Sonos playlists within a third-party interface

â¢ In an early preview phase, capabilities to provide notifications and alerts from third-party devices, like a doorbell, through Sonos speakers. Sonos will invite partners to get certified and earn the âWorks with Sonosâ badge. The badge will signal to Sonos owners that companies building and innovating on our platform deliver experiences that meet the Sonos high bar for quality.

THE VERDICT

Yamaha’s unique DSP-surround technology sets apart what is otherwise still a strong A/V receiver in a highly competitive market niche.


I get to review a lot of A/V receivers. Familiarity breeding— well, familiarity— I confess that I tend to sort new examples into one of three classes. The flagship models cost a lot, pump out 140 or so watts from each of at least nine and often more channels, and they tend to cram in every conceivable feature. Entry-level jobs are cheap, five- or seven-channel affairs that usually top out at 65-or-so real watts per channel and incorporate more basic feature sets. Everything in between I callously lump into the “commodity-class” rubric. These are the ones nearly everybody actually ends up buying, and for good reason: they’re still heavily featured and impressively capable, but seductively priced at one-third to one-half what the cruisers and battleships cost, and just a couple of Franklins above the cheap ‘n’ cheerfuls.

But much like Orwell’s farm animals, some, like Yamaha’s latest example, the $599 RX-V685, are more individual than others. The V685 has all the expected check boxes: Dolby Atmos/DTS:X surround decoding with seven onboard channels of amplifier power to provide for a 5.1.2 front-height setup (or 7.1 surround with surround-back speakers); HDMI with full HDR compatibility and video processing including output resolution up to 4K; and a generous helping of wired and wireless streaming-audio options, including Pandora and Tidal, plus full participation in Yamaha’s proprietary MusicCast multiroom-audio ecosystem.

Unfortunately, along with most of its class cohort the V685 lacks the line-level rear-height outputs that would permit users to add an outboard stereo amplifier, such as a mothballed stereo receiver or integrated amp, to provide power for a “full” 5.1.4-channel Atmos/DTS:X system. Pretty much in concert, the industry seems to have agreed (with “No collusion!” I’m sure), to force buyers requiring nine-channel capability to move up-range to the near-flagship models at the $1,200 or higher price level. That’s a shame, in my book since system-growth expansion options are a foundation stone of the A/V hobby, something that lures unsuspecting users every deeper into audio and home theater.



Two factors set the new RX-V685 Yamaha apart. One is the firm’s longstanding DSP-surround, an ability that can bloom stereo (and surround) recordings into richer, more detailed ambient experiences than can Dolby or DTS “Music” modes. Brand-Y has been the leading proponent of applying digital signal processing to the recreation of acoustic environments for some four decades, and its technical expertise, at least in the consumer space, is without serious rival. I am in general a fan: when judiciously applied to selected— that is, naturally recorded—acoustic music, Yamaha’s processing, currently marketed under the “Cinema DSP 3D” rubric, can deliver a remarkable simulacrum of natural space.

The second is the V685’s option to deploy a pair of Yamaha’s MusicCast wireless speakers in the surround position, obviating the need for long speaker-wire runs to the rear of the room (see sidebar). MusicCast is Yamaha’s proprietary wireless-multiroom ecosystem, competing in the distributed-music space with rivals such as Sonos and Denon’s Heos. Yamaha also states that the V685 can integrate Amazon Alexa voice-assistant control through MusicCast, a feature my dystopia-phobia prevented me from exploring.

Setup

Unboxing Yamaha’s latest revealed the familiar, black-rectangle format (would somebody please make an AVR in a different shape, like a sphere, maybe, or a banana?), with a single volume knob and numerous small, tinily-labeled pushbuttons for input and mode selection and other functions. (Apparently, our onscreen era makes legible panel graphics superfluous. I can’t think of any A/V receiver fascia that does not require a flashlight and a magnifying glass.) Hooking up the usual complement of HDMI and speaker cables, I set theV685 into my system in a 5.1.2-channel configuration, with front-height “ceiling-bounce” speakers perched atop my long-serving Energy Veritas standmount monitors. The Yamaha’s speaker outs are plastic multi-ways spaced too wide to accept standard half-inch dual-bananas, alas.

Yamaha RX-V line up very good DSP modes, so-so amp 

    Submitted by drny on August 29, 2018 - 5:16pm  

I love Yamaha's five channel stereo mode for music listening.
The caveat being that full 3 way range speakers (read towers) are needed truly enjoy your music.
The downfall of the RX-V line has always been the middle of the road amp (the same can be said of all Receivers under $1,000).
For those who dare to push any middle of the road Receiver beyond -12db be forewarned, they will clip well before decent full range speakers distortion level becomes unpleasant.
If they don't clip they will overheat,unless you are using an over head cooling fan.
Now, if you enjoy your music / movies at respectable levels (or use headphones), then by all means enjoy.

Measurements?

What happened to your measurements section? When I first noticed a review w/o measurements, I missed it, but let it go, now it's obvious you're doing away with the only feature that kept me coming back.
It was the only thing that differentiated S&V from the rest, now your reviews are no more than another person's subjective opinion- and it means nothing to me. The only reason I can think of is that you're doing it to appease the receiver manufacturers- what with their 10% THD ratings and other corner cutting measures.
I blame the new guy!!! When he announced his appointment, many readers got excited because of his track record, now I wonder.

 Got a bass-bumping home audio system but also got serious smart-speaker envy? The new Sonos Amp is here to save your old speakers by integrating them into Sonosâ ecosystem and adding a few new tricks along the way.  Sonos unveiled the new amp this morning which is the successor to the companyâs Connect:Amp. While itâs not something more normal consumers will buy, it could help Sonos become a mainstay in serious audio systems created by professional installers. eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'cultofmac_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0'])); Take a look:   eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'cultofmac_com-box-4','ezslot_2']));Sonos Amp is twice as powerful as the Connect:Amp and it supports AirPlay 2. Like the companyâs other smart speakers, it can tap into over 100 streaming services. Thereâs also an HDMI Arc port in the back so you can plug it into your TV.  The Amp was designed from the ground up to be at the center of the smart home sound experience. Over 100 dealers and integrators gave Sonos feedback on what theyâd like to see in an amp and the stats are mighty impressive. With the ability to power up to four speakers with 125 watts per channel, itâs more than powerful enough to handle most audio set-ups. âWhile plug-and-play options like Sonos Beam and Sonos One are an important part of the equation, architectural sound and making it even easier to integrate with lighting and home control are equally as important,â said Sonos CEO Patrick Spence. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'cultofmac_com-banner-1','ezslot_1'])); Sonos Amp fits perfectly in standard AV racks and can be stacked and mounted. TVs, turntables, CD changers and other audio components can connect to it easily and become part of your home Sonos system. The amp is set to go on sale in February 2019 for $599. Professional installers in the U.S. and Canada will start getting it on December 1, 2018 though so you might be able to get it in your home by the end of the year.  ",0.02,0.809,0.171,0.9956

Santa Barbara-based Sonos--the Central Coast's newest IPO darling--said on Wednesday that it has launched a new product called Sonos Amp, and also said it plans to work closer with third parties to integrate into its technology. The new Sonos Amp is a home audio amplifier, tied into the very well connected Sonos streaming ecosystem, but which powers traditional, wired speakers. Sonos said it also plans to support televisions, turntables, compact disc players, and other audio players with the new device. Sonos said that it is looking to open up its platform to connect to voice assistants, security systems, and other smart home technology, with a new set of application programming interfaces (APIs) which it calls its ""Control APIs"".

As the name might imply for those into home theater tech, it isn't just another standalone speaker for the company's lineup. The new Sonos Amp is... well, an amp. It's twice as powerful as the previous Connect:Amp at 250W (125W per channel, two channels), and it has less of the Connect's cheese-grater look going on, with a slightly more modern and shorter matte black package. It'll also be a bit more expensive at $600, with availability set for February 2019.   Controls on the unit itself remain simple, with three flush capacitive buttons for volume, track forward/back, and play/pause. And if the understated design doesn't do it for you or you'd rather save some space, the Sonos Amp can be wall or rack mounted as well. It works with over 100 services, can be controlled via Alexa, and the Amp also supports Apple's AirPlay 2 (if you're part of that ecosystem). Like all Sonos products, it will get new features over time with subsequent updates. Among such upcoming features are Line-in switching via third-party interfaces, volume pass-through, third-party interaction with Sonos playlists, and notification support for third-party devices (doorbells, etc.). ""Professional installers"" in the US and Canada can get their hands on the Sonos Amp early starting this December, but the rest of us lowly consumers will have to wait until February 2019, apparently. Sonos Unveils all-new Sonos Amp to power smart home entertainment, doubles down on commitment to Installed Solutions channel
Santa Barbara, Calif. – August 29, 2018 – Today, Sonos (Nasdaq: SONO) unveiled the all-new Sonos Amp, a powerful and versatile home audio hub that powers traditional wired speakers with sound from nearly any source, and fully integrates these speakers into Sonos’ easy-to-use wireless home sound system.
Amp will be available globally February 2019. New collaboration with industry leader Sonance will focus on creation of a series of architectural speakers to complement Sonos Amp; Sonos fully opens developer platform and adds new control APIs. Santa Barbara, Calif. – August 29, 2018 – Today, Sonos (Nasdaq: SONO) unveiled the all-new Sonos Amp, a powerful and versatile home audio hub that powers traditional wired speakers with sound from nearly any source, and fully integrates these speakers into Sonos’ easy-to-use wireless home sound system. The all-new Amp is twice as powerful as its predecessor, supports Apple’s AirPlay 2 and more than 100 streaming services, and includes an HDMI Arc port for TVs. Launching globally in February 2019, the $599 Amp will be available to professional installers in the United States and Canada starting Dec. 1, 2018. Amp is designed to fit perfectly into standard AV racks used by custom install professionals, and can power up to four speakers with 125 watts per channel—more than enough for even the most demanding set-ups. Onboard HDMI and line-in ports means TVs, turntables, CD changers, and other audio components can easily connect with Amp and become part of the Sonos system. Amp’s thoughtfully designed and versatile hardware was built to power the Sonos software platform. New updates to the platform make it easy for installers to incorporate Amp into integrated smart home set-ups, including smart lighting and centralized control systems. It is also AirPlay 2 compatible, meaning music and other audio from any iOS device can be played wirelessly through Amp. And when wirelessly connected to an Amazon Alexa-enabled device like a Sonos One or Beam, Amp is controllable with voice commands. Finally, like other Sonos devices, Amp will gain new features, services, and integrations over time through free software updates, ensuring customers will get the best from their set-up for years to come. “The growth of the Sonic Internet – the convergence of paid streaming, the smart home, and artificial intelligence through voice technologies drives everything we do at Sonos,” said Sonos CEO Patrick Spence. “While plug-and-play options like Sonos Beam and Sonos One are an important part of the equation, architectural sound and making it even easier to integrate with lighting and home control are equally as important. We’ve listened to custom installers and dealers to create Amp, a versatile product designed to be at the center of the smart home sound experience.” Sonos Amp Product Specifics: Sonos and Sonance Collaborate on Architectural Sound
Sonos and architectural audio leader Sonance have announced a collaboration aimed at delivering a series of three architectural speakers - in-wall, in-ceiling and outdoor - that gain additional functionality through software when paired with the new Sonos Amp. This collaboration will provide a complete offering for professionally installed architectural sound, exclusively enabling Sonos’ Trueplay tuning capabilities to ensure the best sound for the space as well as the benefits of Sonos’ software platform. These products, which will be sold and marketed by Sonos, will launch in early 2019. Open Developer Platform and New Control APIs
Sonos has been a platform company since day one, with a goal of giving customers unparalleled freedom of choice, starting with an open approach to music services and expanding to support dozens of additional content and control partners, including multiple voice services. Starting in early September, Sonos will further evolve the developer platform by fully opening up to all potential partners and will also add a new set of Control APIs, making it easier than ever to integrate Sonos into the smart home. The platform will continue to expand with new APIs that allow partners to innovate on their integrations with Sonos. New Control APIs and features make the experience better for customers, especially those with integrated control systems, such as Control4 and Crestron. These include: Sonos will invite partners to get certified and earn the “Works with Sonos” badge. The badge will signal to Sonos owners that companies building and innovating on our platform deliver experiences that meet the Sonos high bar for quality.

It'd be great if this had multiple HDMI inputs and could replace my home theatre setup, but I suspect that won't be the case. Sonos makes soundbars that could do that. You can even pair them with Sonos Play 1 speakers. Well.. you might have not read what he wrote, but no Sonos product has multiple HDMI inputs. The Beam has one, the Playbase and the Playbar both work with one Optical Connection. Jon's case study is to have x devices connected to the Sonos device. Nevertheless: @jon_hewitt:disqus why not use the TV as passthrough for sound using the Optical Connection? I'm just being a stick in the mud. I don't want to do things the Sonos way and have one of every of their products for my home theatre setup. I should probably just buy a Connect, but that hasn't been updated in years, and it's stupidly expensive for the job I want it to do - 'Sonosify' my existing setup. Couldn't you plug a $35 Chromecast Audio into whatever your existing speakers are currently connected to and get like 90% of whatever this thing is offering? Depends on the speaker you are plugging it into. Most people won't be able to tell the difference between this and a $300 speaker, but those same people would be able to tell the difference between this and a $30 speaker. But this is an amplifier and not a speaker at all, so it must be aimed at people who already have speakers they like and just want to sonos-ify them. I used to think this way, and what your saying is true. I used to have the same system your talking about with Chromecast Audio and it worked great around the house. But the experience of having Sonos speakers is so much more consistent. I rarely have random drops. Plus it was quite the upgrade from my previous speaker set up. But you could definitely do this same thing with a ton of Chromecast Audio, which would be cheaper What do you mean by random drops? The audio cuts out? I've never had anything like this happen on my Chromecast audio.   What do you think of the upcoming Pixel 3 XL (so far)?  View Results  Discuss This Poll",0.014,0.832,0.154,0.9997

That's a long time in the world of wireless audio. Right on cue, the new Sonos Amp has arrived to fill in the bits its predecessor couldn't. That means major hardware and software upgrades that will benefit anyone wanting to use theirÂ own speakers but incorporate Sonos' streaming smarts. The big upgrade is the HDMI ARC port, most recently seen on the Sonos Beam, which will allow the Amp to control your TV. However, the Amp will still work with your analogue gear such as turntables thanks to two RCA inputs, plus has extra streaming capabilitiesÂ like AirPlay 2 built in. Audiophiles will also welcome the increased power of the Amp at 125W per channel - more than twice that of its predecessor - with the added ability toÂ power four speakers instead of just two. Aesthetically speaking, the new Amp is designed to sit out in the open with looks that complement older gear, but the real target here is the custom install market. Installers can make sure the volume in certain rooms doesn't go above a preset limit, or ensure that the audio levels dip when your connected doorbell is ringing.

The idea isn’t entirely new â Sonos already has the Connect:Amp â but that’s a few years old and ripe for an update. The Sonos Amp is twice as powerful as its predecessor, packing 125 watts per channel, which means (on paper at least least) it’s more than capable of powering even the most demanding speakers. Better still, you can now power up to four speakers instead of two. Connectivity is also fully refreshed. The Sonos Amp supports Apple AirPlay 2 to send sound from your iPhone or iPad to any connected speaker, plus you’ll be able to use Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal â Sonos’ ecosystem now supports over 100 streaming services. Related: Sonos tips and tricks The Sonos Amp even has love for your TV. It features the same HDMI ARC module used on the Sonos Beam. The idea is that you can use the Sonos ecosystem to drive your movie sound, and maybe even pair a couple of Sonos One units as surround speakers. Or you can set up a Sonos Beam at the front of the room, and use the Sonos Amp to drive your own in-wall loudspeakers at the back. A set of RCA analogue inputs is ideal for adding your old turntable to the mix. There’s also a subwoofer output, and you’re able to manually adjust the crossover frequency to determine how much bass is sent to the sub. Th speaker terminals are very neat. For those not particularly dextrous, or for those who just don’t want to spend time digging around the back of the AV rack, the speaker terminals are removable. You can pull them out as easily as an RCA plug, install your speaker wiring, and them put them back in. What an ingenious idea. Related: Best multi-room speakers The system is designed to work wirelessly, but you can’t beat wired connections for reliability. To that end, Sonos has added not one but two Ethernet sockets. Sonos has also paid a lot of attention to the chassis. There’s a centralised heatsink with a chimney-like heat management system, and there’s a screw mount at the bottom, designed to let you stick the Sonos Amp on the wall. Oh, and Sonos tells me the Amp has been through thorough drop-testing, because they had clumsy people in mind. It certainly feels like it â the box is dense. Related: Best Sonos deals The bad news? The Sonos Amp won’t be released until February 2019, when it will be priced at $599 in the US and â¬699 in the EMEA region, so you’ll have to find another snazzy bit of Sonos kit for under the Christmas tree this year.

 or Already registered? Log in here Sonos just made three new announcements at IFA 2018 which will make your connected home work better, look better and sound better. It's all about versatility! Here are the details on the new set of APIs, the partnership with Sonance for hidden architectural speakers, and of course, the new hardware: the Sonos Amp. The first announcement made was about the new set of control APIs which aim to make Sonos more integrated with other platforms and services, and ultimately, the center of your smart home. By opening up to developers, Sonos' products will become a more dynamic part of your home in ways we can't yet envision, but the possibilities are endless on the software side of the equation. On the hardware side of things, the new Sonos Amp was announced. It can work with four speakers, rather than just two like the old version, and it outputs 125 watts per channel at 8 ohms. The higher price, $599 in the US and 699 euros in Europe, reflects this. It's a sleek amp that wouldn't be out of place next to your TV, on a shelf or even mounted vertically on a wall. The circular top, which helps it keep cool, resembles a turntable for an extra dash of hip. This minimal device features an IR receiver, a status light, a play/pause button and volume up and down buttons on the front. If you've got the Sonos One or Beam which come with Alexa, the Sonos Amp will play nice with Alexa so you can use voice control. Other software aspects include the ability to set volume limits and disconnect the device from WiFi via app, which will also roll out to some existing Sonos products in the future. Things only get complicated on the back, where the exciting parts come in for the sake of connectivity. There is a (much requested) HDMI port for connecting to a TV, which lets your TV act as a 'phantom' center channel if you've got speakers on either side, two ethernet ports, audio input for connecting to your old-school vinyl turntable, not to mention AirPlay 2 support and more. All of these connectivity possibilities mean that you can have it all: a mix of digital and analog, the old and the new. The problem with custom in-home audio, apart from the price, is that having a great audio setup can often involve having unsightly, bulky speakers all over the place. That's why the announcement that has me most excited is Sonos' partnership with a company called Sonance, which will involve 'architectural speakers'. These will be built into walls and ceilings, and for the outdoors. We'll have to wait and see what special functionality the Amp will add to them, but the wait won't be long since these are scheduled to be released in early 2019. What do you think of Sonos' announcements? What other features would you like to see? Let us know in the comments!

 Yesterday, Apple released a firmware update for their discontinued Airport Express wireless router adding AirPlay 2 support and today,Â Sonos has also announced a brand new Amp speaker with AirPlay 2 compatibility.Â The new Sonos Amp ($599) lets users connect traditional home audio speakers with a Sonos system, and replaces the oldÂ Connect: Amp.  The new Sonos Amp outputs 125 watts per channel at 8 ohms and can power four speakers instead of two.Â The Amp can be used to add stereo sound to a TV, thanks to HDMI Arc support, or add wireless rears to a Sonos theatre setup. Two Sonos Amps can also be used to add a complete surround sound system. It also works with Alexa when used in conjunction with an Amazon Alexa-enabled Sonos device. Meanwhile, Sonos has also announced an expansion of its developer program, unveilingÂ upcoming Control APIs that the company says will make it easier to integrate Sonos into the smart home (via The Verge). The company willÂ fully open up the program to all potential partners on September 6th. “But the most interesting piece is something that will start in a âpreview phaseâ: audio notifications. Third-party devices like connected doorbells will be able to send notifications and alerts to your Sonos speakers. This is completely separate from the Alexa support that Sonos already offers; itâs a direct hook between devices and Sonos hardware. Jones said that Sonos is working with Samsungâs SmartThings division on possible ways of using audio notifications.” Check out the teaser for the new Sonos Amp below, which will be available for purchase for home installation specialists in the US and Canada first, starting December 1, 2018.

 Well, this was unexpected. Sonos takes years to do a hardware launch then it has three in the space of 12 months.  But while the Sonos Beam and Sonos One were pushed squarely at consumers looking to upgrade their TV and audio setups, the Sonos Amp is catering to both the custom install market and those who want some oomph in their connected home setup. 
 It's taken Sonos over 10 years to update its Sonos Connect Amp. And this is an update as it will be replacing that old, still sturdy model. But replace it it has with an amp which is twice as powerful as its predecessor.  What does that mean in real money? Well, it packs 125 Watts per channel - so this amp can power speakers that are that little bit demanding. It also has the added bonus of being able to power up to four speakers instead of two.  And then there's the design. The Sonos Amp only comes in black. This, according to Sonos, is deliberate as it is the only color that custom install folks really care about - and that is a big bit of the market that this product is being pitched at, as it is a device that sits pretty next to your record player but also slots neatly into a rack.  Design-wise, it takes its cue from the recent design flourishes of the Sonos Play:5 and Sonos Beam. The touch buttons and vertical light on the front have the same design as those devices, and on the top is a circular unit with the Sonos logo.  It's much more compact than you would expect from a device of this magnitude and sitting next to the big screen where we saw it unveiled, it looked a little like a games console so certainly not imposing.  The Sonos Amp isn't just about power, but connectivity. This thing is as connected as any other recent Sonos reveal. There's AirPlay 2, voice support and HDMI ARC so it will slot nicely into most TV setups.  It also has analog for your record player and dual ethernet ports on the back. There's Wi-Fi too but this can be switched fully off when the ethernet ports are in action.  The Sonos Amp can also be used to add stereo sound to TV, add wireless rears to a Sonos home-theater setup or, if you are feeling fancy, two Amps can combine for surround sound.   The Sonos Amp isn't for everyone. It's for high-end audio enthusiasts who want to modernize their setup and custom installers who are looking fo a connected solution to beef up an AV setup.  But that's no bad thing - Sonos looks to have created a device that will fit into CI needs. It even surveyed 400 or so installers to see what they wanted and has opened up its API to accommodate this.  This has lead to new features, which include: Line-in switching, volume passthrough and third-party notifications and alerts - so the potential is there to hook your smart doorbell up with your sound system.  The Sonos Amp is out in December for custom installers. For the rest of us, it will be available in February for $599 / 699 Euros (other pricing TBC).  Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

 In the past few years, wireless speakers have gotten good. Like, really good. But the number of options still pale in comparison to the wealth of traditional speakers on the market, especially for those seeking audiophile-quality sound. For these folks, Sonos has had its Connect:Amp, which could power passive speakers through regular speaker wire. Today, the company is announcing the simply named Sonos Amp, which is both more powerful and more versatile than its predecessor.  It's called Hard Fork. Where the Connect:Amp could handle two speakers at 55 Watts each, the new model can output 125W per speaker. Better yet, you can actually stack the amps like pancakes to connect even more speakers for a full surround setup (although unfortunately it doesnât seem Dolby Atmos is an option). You can use all the usual Sonos streaming sources, including the recently introduced AirPlay 2 support. The Amp also borrow the HDMI ARC connection from the Sonos Beam, making it a bit easier to connect to your TV, though you can use an optical audio adapter if your prefer. Of course, thereâs also a line-in for analog sources. That said, after all of Sonosâ efforts to enter the voice-controlled space, the lack of microphones is disappointing. You can still use voice control with another Alexa-powered device (and Google Assistant, someday), but it wouldâve been nice to have an all-in-one solution as with its newer speakers. The Sonos Amp will cost for $599 when it goes on sale December 1 at Sonos.com. Â

 RIVA Audio are launching a brand new line of high-quality wireless speakers at IFA 2018, with Alexa functionality pouring out of its cones. As the first third-party speakers to come with the full Amazon Alexa package built in, the RIVA Voice Series will form part of Amazon’s official line-up of Alexa speakers. A press release cited the new range as Amazon’s “official entry into the wireless speaker arena”. The RIVA CONCERT (£199/$199) is a standalone 50W speaker with an optional 20h battery pack and splash-resistant casing, for those wanting to take their music outside. The 200W RIVA STADIUM (£449/$449) is the bulkier option, with a 200W output you’ll need a plug socket for. As the first voice-controlled speakers from the audio specialists – who made their name with live music events for the likes of Led Zepellin and Jimi Hendrix – both RIVA devices come with the full range of Alexa capabilities.  Aside from the main business of high-fidelity audio playback, that means you get calls and messages to other Alexa devices, Alexa skills, Spotify and Amazon Music compatibility, as well as more mundane tasks like managing shopping lists and asking the weather. Other neat features include a dedicated RIVA app, with a ‘push to talk’ function to use voice commands through your smartphone, as well as independent volume controls that distinguish between music playback and Alexa’s voice. Multi-room playback across various RIVA devices is set to follow at a later date. With Amazon having developed a wide range of Alexa-powered speakers for the home for different tastes and price points – from the miniature Echo Dot to the more premium Echo Plus – the next step was always going to be high-quality audio. There’s only so much bass you can get out of a standard Echo’s drivers, which are geared more toward casual listening and simple voice commands than serious audio fidelity. While there are already Alexa-compatible speakers out there, this is the first time Amazon has thrown their weight behind a particular range. Sonos was one of the first off the line, with both the Sonos One and Sonos Beam compatible with Alexa, though the smart assistant’s features are still being added and refined. Bose is also getting in on the Alexa action, with a dedicated smart speaker seeing release later this year.

It's got a lot of limitations, though. You have to specifically tell Siri you want it to play through the Sonos One, for example. If you want better Siri integration, you may want to check out the HomePod instead. For some, it's all-Apple or nothing. If it's not Siri-compatible, then it doesn't come through the front door. I get that. I have the full Apple ecosystem running throughout my house. Though Sonos One does work with Siri. It doesn't really work all that well with Siri. When you want to play music, for example, you have to specify to Siri that you want to play it through the Sonos One. That's because you're triggering Siri from your iPhone to relay instructions, not the Sonos One speaker itself. The HomePod, however, has Siri built in. That means you could just holler ""Hey Siri play something I like,"" into the general room while your iPhone is locked in a vault and Siri will take care of business for you via the HomePod. HomePod also has more integrated personal features like the ability to tell you what's on your agenda for the day and the weather forecast. That being said, Sonos One has Alexa support integrated into the speaker itself (much the way Siri is integrated into the HomePod). Though you do need your phone to set it up, you ask Alexa to play any supported streaming music (and there are a lot of options for that). Using Alexa on Sonos One is pretty much the same as using Alexa on an Echo device, so you've got a lot of options for Amazon's digital assistant, including your daily schedule, creating and adding to shopping lists, writing notes, and using skills. That's right, with Sonos One, you can play Jeopardy. If you don't mind using Alexa some of the time, the Sonos One is a much better speaker for serving your digital assistant needs. Though it doesn't work directly with Siri, and your Siri triggers on Sonos One are limited, it's still the best speaker in terms of digital assistants when it comes to providing versatility. Sonos One is integrated with Alexa and offers native support for a huge list of streaming services. If the only thing you care about is Siri and you definitely don't want Amazon having access to your personal data (something Alexa needs permission to use), you're better off with a HomePod. It natively streams Apple Music and has Siri built right in. Lory is a renaissance woman, writing news, reviews, and how-to guides for iMore. She also fancies herself a bit of a rock star in her town and spends too much time reading comic books.Â Â If she's not typing away at her keyboard, you can probably find her at Disneyland or watching Star Wars (or both).",0.02,0.838,0.142,0.9944

 @iPeterCao Along with upgrading the majority of its older products to support AirPlay 2, and its recently announced Beam soundbar, Sonos today is announcing a new iteration of its Amp, which will also be gaining support for Apple’s latest wireless standard. 

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The new Sonos Amp will be twice as powerful as its predecessor, the Connect:Amp, and will have support for AirPlay 2, HDMI ARC (for TVs that support it), and will be able to stream from more than 100 streaming services. At $599, the new Amp will be launching in February of 2019. Professional installers will have access to the new Amp in the U.S. and Canada starting on December 1, 2018. Sonos will also be partnering up with Sonance to deliver in-wall, in-ceiling, and outdoor speakers. These will be able to pair up with the Sonos Amp. While there’s no official date, Sonos says these will ship sometime in early 2019. Lastly, the company is announcing a handful of new APIs for its developers. The most prominent is the new Control APIs, which will allow better integration with the smart home. While Sonos is careful not to mention any specific brand, this could mean HomeKit integration, similar to the just-announced AirPlay 2 update for AirPort Express. Iâve been personally eyeing the old Connect:Amp, but now that the new Amp includes AirPlay 2, I may wait for that. Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:

 Sonos has used IFA 2018 to announce a brand-new product and reveal that it is opening up its API, in the hope that it will be the center of your smart home. The new product is a redesigned Sonos amp, which has twice the power of the old Connect amp and can be used it in a wide variety of situations. Oh, and you can stream music off of it too.  
 It has an HDMI port on the back as well as audio inputs, so you can power your vinyl collection with it.  It will support AirPlay 2 and has a new form factor and design which allows it to fit inside a rack configuration and can be mounted, or exhibited on furniture.  The Sonos Connect Amp has been around for over 10 years now, so Sonos has redesigned the device and added more power in the form of 120 watts per channel.  The Connect amp wasn't optimized for TV, so Sonos has rectified this by taking the HDMI Arc module out of the Sonos Beam and put it into this new amp. It also has an IR receiver so it can control your TV, too. According to Sonos, this is the biggest advancement from the company in the connected home space so far. Sonos has also revealed that it wants to be the center of the smart home and it will do this by opening up its API to developers.  It will also be releasing a new set of control APIs which will make it easier for developers to integrate into the Sonos system. Some of these APIs will be ready for the Sonos amp so you will be able to do things like notifications through the Sonos system and volume pass through.  The Sonos Amp will be out in February 2019 and will be $599 (€699, other pricing TBC) - but it will only come in black, the custom installers' color of choice.

Targeting professional installers, the new Sonos Amp is designed to fit into a standard AV rack.  
  It’s a return to some of Sonos’ earliest products, back when the company launched with its Zone Player amplifiers. Since then, the Zone Player had rebranded as Connect, though the concept remained the same. Those with an existing audio system that they wanted to keep using could add a Connect to include wireless streaming support too. The new Sonos Amp, though, has a number of improvements. For a start it’s twice as powerful as before, has 125 watts per channel, and its Class-D digital amplifiers can drive up to four speakers versus its predecessor’s two.  On the back of the matte black box there are custom black and silver banana plugs for 10-18AWG speaker wire. There’s also a subwoofer output, an auto-detecting RCA type with adjustable crossover (50 to 110 Hz). In addition to wireless connectivity – including the Sonos Amp acting as a SonosNet extender – there are dual ethernet ports for wired connections. The second port can be used to get other devices online.  There’s also line-in support, happy with either a line-level analog RCA connection or, via an adapter, an optical digital connection. An HDMI ARC port connects a TV. A Sonos Amp could be used to add stereo sound to a TV, and then either a pair of wireless Sonos speakers added for rear sound, or a second Sonos Amp for surround sound.  As you’d expect, the new hardware also gets the same software and streaming features as Sonos’ other recent products. You can, of course, stream from any of the 100+ services – like Apple Music, Spotify, or Pandora – that are natively supported in the Sonos app. In addition, there’s Apple AirPlay 2 support, for streaming directly from an iOS device.  On-device controls include touch buttons for volume, music track skipping, and play/pause. There’s no integrated smart assistant support, like Amazon Alexa on the Sonos One and Sonos Beam; however, if you pair an Echo device with the Sonos Amp you can control it by voice. Considering Sonos envisages the new amplifier being tucked away in an AV rack somewhere, that probably makes more sense than having a microphone array that might not be within listening range.  Unlike the bulk of Sonos’ current range of all-in-one speakers, the Sonos Amp takes a more flexible approach. Installers will be able to set it up for either stereo or dual mono sound, for instance, or take the speaker connectors off and use their own banana plugs. There’ll be new Sonos APIs, too, including line-switching – for both analog and home theater – that will allow line-in components to be selected within a third-party UI.  Other new APIs will include volume pass-through and the ability to add Sonos playlists within a third-party interface. A preview phrase of a new notifications and alerts system will allow third-party devices – like connected doorbells – to be delivered through Sonos speakers. A new “Works with Sonos” badge will be offered to certified third-party companies should work seamlessly with the speakers.  One of the first fruits of that project will be a new set of in-wall, in-ceiling, and outdoor speakers. Made by Sonance, and to be sold and marketed by Sonos, the new speakers will support Sonos Trueplay tuning and other extra features.  The Sonos Amp will launch for professional installers in North America on December 1, 2018, priced at $599. As of February 2019, it’ll roll out globally. The Sonos/Sonance architectural speakers will go on sale in early 2019, while the new Control APIs for better integrating pro-install Sonos hardware into smart home systems will show up from early September this year.

Although it lacks an onboard microphone, it will also be controllable via Alexa voice commands if you own an Alexa-capable device like aÂ Sonos One ($199 at Amazon.com)Â or Beam, or anÂ Amazon Echo ($85 at Amazon.com)Â speaker. When Sonos launches support for Google Assistant, the Amp will work with those devices too. Other features include: One of the main problems with the original Connect:Amp was that it didn't really synchronize with audio from a TV. The new HDMI input promises easy AV sync when connected to a television, and audio from the TV can pass to the amp via Audio Return Channel (ARC) -- similar to theÂ Sonos Beam ($399 at Amazon.com). That also means you can listen to TV audio elsewhere in the house on another Sonos speaker. Design-wise, the Amp is essentially a shortened, black cube at 8.54 inches square and 2.52 inches high. It includes internal heat sinks so it can be stacked with other amps, though the company suggests active cooling in professional applications.  The front of the unit is minimalist, with a play/pause button and an area you can swipe for skipping tracks as well as volume up/down. The back of the Amp has a pair of proprietary thumb-screw speaker terminals but these can be removed completely to reveal normal banana plug inputs. There's also an Ethernet port in case you don't want to rely on Wi-Fi. The Amp doesn't include the digital-to-analog converter found on most of its kind, instead using aÂ Qualcomm DDFA amplifier, which keeps the signal digital until the last possible moment. The analog input still features an analog-to-digital converter though, and the signal -- say of a record player -- can be streamed to other Sonos units in the home. I've seen plenty of compact amps based on Class D technology, but some -- such as theÂ Creative X-Fi X7Â -- are less than ""serious"" audio components. With its power upgrade, hopefully the Sonos Amp can finally compete or even better the likes of theÂ Marantz NRÂ series or theÂ Elac Element. The Amp can also be run in conjunction with a wirelessÂ Sonos SubÂ or with a pair of smaller Sonos speakers, such as theÂ Play:1s, as rears. Sonos' demo setup with the Amp powering B&W tower speakers. I heard the Sonos Amp connected to a pair ofÂ Bowers & Wilkins 702 S2Â speakers at an event in Boston last week, in the same room as I first heard theÂ Sonos Playbase ($699 at Amazon.com). While the demo wasn't as attention-grabbing as the Playbase, the Amp nonetheless demonstrated how it could operate as a straight two-channel amp or be split to operate as part of a 4.1 setup. I look forward to testing the amp in the CNET office, but maybe a pair of the more affordableÂ Bowers & Wilkins 606Â would make a better fit. With all of the improvements, at $600 the Amp is $100 more expensive than the previous version. It will be available from December on the Sonos website and to custom installers in the US, and will go into worldwide distribution in February 2019. It'll cost Â£600 in the UK and AU$1,000 in Australia. While we're on the topic of upgrading aging components, one thing I'm still holding out for is an update on the company's oldest product, the ZP100 (now Connect). A $350 Wi-Fi dongle was a big deal when it was released, but even the newÂ Works With Sonos programÂ -- a Sonos Connect operating in tandem with an Onkyo receiver -- can't help the device compete in a world where the $35Â Chromecast Audio ($35 at Walmart)Â exists. Here's hoping. Best speakers for 2018: Hand-picked by CNET. Sonos Playbase review: Sonos hits a home run with this under-TV speaker system.

Sonos has always been happy to open up their platform to curated/vetted partners, but with their new public APIs coming to the entire product line in September, anyone can tap into Sonos without any prior approval. Their “Works with Sonos” certification program will still exist for partners that want to go deep with integration, but is no longer mandatory. This means that something like an IFTTT service for Sonos is not only possible, it’s coming, folks. What does this mean for us? Well, IFTTT is a perfect example. Want to have your Sonos auto-stop when you leave the house and resume when you get home? You can build an IFTTT recipe to do exactly that. Fully open APIs also mean that developers can bake Sonos controls right into their apps without needing any additional coordination or approval from Sonos. Initial API features launching in September will be: As someone who has had plenty of gadgets around the house for a long time, it’s things like IFTTT triggers that make the whole concept of “Smart Home” really work. Having one device automatically trigger some other device to do something without my direct involvement is really the key here, and having Sonos join the smart home in this way is stellar. It’s important to note that the foundation for these new APIs is anything but new. Sonos has been using this API for various things over the years, including their Alexa support. Initially all API calls will be cloud-based, though local/LAN-based support is on the roadmap.  For years, Sonos has offered their Connect:Amp product, but it’s gotten to be a little long in the tooth. Anytime a Mac Geek Gab listener would ask us about solving a problem where Connect:Amp would be the right answer, I’d always have to provide a lot of context with a lot of asterisks. Its age makes Connect:Amp a feature-limited device that can’t fully be a first-class citizen on your Sonos network in the way that all other Sonos devices can. Those problems are now gone with the introduction of the Sonos Amp, available in the USA from Sonos and certified installers in December, globally in February, 2019. While most folks won’t find need for a US$599 amplifier to pair their existing speakers with a Sonos system, there are certain use cases where this is necessary. Built-in setups, a set of speakers that are special to you for their sound or visual aesthetic, and outdoor installations are just the first three most common scenarios we’re routinely asked about. The new Sonos Amp can power up to four speakers (in parallel stereo), AirPlay 2 works through it, it has an HDMI input port to perfectly sync with your TV, and it will connect wirelessly to your Sonos system, meaning placement is no longer dictated by the availability of Ethernet cables like it was with the Connect:Amp. All of this shows Sonos’s increased commitment to opening their platform up for others to use in ways beyond that which Sonos’s core speakers and apps allow, and that’s where things really start to get fun. Compared to Apple’s very closed Smart Home architecture with HomeKit, it’s refreshing to see a company like Sonos continuing to embrace an open system in a way that still maintains quality and allows for the development of excellent solutions by third parties.

But long before Sonos wireless speakers revolutionized multiroom audio, the company had already revolutionized the custom-install market with its ZP100 Connect amplifier (released in 2005 — we wrote about the successor, the ZP120, back in 2009).Â That product used the brandâs unique software to not only connect wired speakers to your network, but also to let custom installers create complex multiroom sound systems throughout the home. Today, August 29, the company gets back to its roots. At a clandestine press event in Boston, Sonos pulled the wrapping off its latest product, a âdirect descendantâ of the ZP100 Connect in the form of a two-channel amplifier with a whole new bag of tricks. Available in February for $599, Sonos calls its new device simply Amp. Carved into a chic black block in Sonosâ signature minimalist style, Ampâs primary purpose is to be sold directly to dealers and installers as a rack-mountable piece of hardware. But like the original ZP100, it can also be placed on your mantle or TV console (or inside it) as a stand-alone network amplifier to power your living room — this is Sonos weâre talking about, after all. 













  Ryan Waniata/Digital Trends Amp offers a basic but useful assortment of connections, including a subwoofer output, an RCA analog connection for a turntable or other analog source, AirPlay 2 support for iOS devices, and ARC HDMI connectionÂ to interface with your TV. Speaker terminals with banana cables allow you to connect of a stereo pair of traditional speakers, with the ability to create a 4.1 surround system via a mix of wired speakers and Sonos smart speakers (the system filters center-channel info from a 5.1 surround systemÂ into the left and right channels). Amp is Carved into a chic black block in Sonosâ signature minimalist style. All of this is integrated with Sonosâ app-based controller, of course, allowing for grouping with other Amps or Sonos speakers for multiroom playback, as well as streaming from virtually any streaming service or storage drive. On-device controls like pause/play, volume, and a âjoinâ button allow you to control basic functions, create groups, and initiate Wi-Fi connection without the app, as well. If you add in a smart speaker for voice control (and if you donât want to pony up for a $200 Sonos One, a $40 Echo DotÂ could do the trick), the power of Alexa could also allow for voice control of basic functions. The functions we’re talking about include hands-free TV power and volume control, along with other smart speaker functions. And Google Assistant — expected to be integrated into Sonosâ software by the end of the year — will add another font of options for a versatile smart-home setup. But combine Amp with other custom-installation hardware/software systems and itâs primed to do a whole lot more. It may seem odd for a company that all but single-handedly pioneered a way to replace custom speaker installations with its wireless speaker lineup to get right back into the custom-install game all these years later. But in a lot of ways, it makes perfect sense. With the rise of the smart home, custom installation has never been hotter, with companies like Control4 and Savant crafting comprehensive solutions that allow you to control just about everything in your home — from your security system to your sprinklers to your entire home theater — all from a simple app and tablet. And Sonos wants a bigger piece of the action. Upgrades to Amp, like its ARC-HDMI connection with CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) and a wrap-around IR repeater that sends remote-control info, make the device much more versatile for home installations than Sonosâ previous amplifier. And a plan to open the Sonos software API to developers in September could be the key to unlocking all sorts of new applications, including integration with a horde of smart-home devices, from smart lights and door locks to custom components that allow for control over an entire smart home. To upgrade its network amplifier, Sonos did its research, honing in on everything people loved about the ZP100 Connect and, more important, everything they hated. For starters, Amp is more than twice as powerful as its predecessor, offering Class D amplification with up to 125 watts per channel for an 8-ohm load (with power stable at 4 ohms), allowing Amp to power virtually any speakers in your collection, from bookshelves to floorstanders. We heard the system connected to a pair of Bowers and Wilkins 702 S2 speakers, and it had no trouble ramping them up to full throttle. To load so much power into such a small amplifier, Sonos engineers had to get creative. To load that much power into such a small package â the unit measures just 8.54 Ã 8.54 Ã 2.52 inches — Amp product manager Benji Rappoport says Sonos engineers had to get creative. The more power an amplifier produces, the hotter it gets, which can be especially problematic when youâre using multiple units for massive speaker installations. Rappoport says a breakthrough moment came when design engineers realized Ampâs inner chassis could also serve as its heat sink, with openings in the circular topside designed to let heat escape. That said, multi-unit rack setups (Sonos software can incorporate up to 32 Amps grouped together) will still need fans for cooling. Ampâs new ARC HDMI connection allows for higher quality, more accurate TV audio, accounting for lip-sync issues incurred by the ZP100 — which Sonos claims was never designed for TV connection in the first place. Amp also offers dual Ethernet ports for connection to LAN 10/100 speeds alongside Wi-Fi connection (which can also be disabled if desired), as well as an adjustable crossover (50Hz to 115Hz) for the subwoofer output as opposed to the previously fixed 80Hz crossover point. As mentioned, Sonos is also upgrading the software side of things to bring new functionality to Amp (and all Sonos hardware). Current upgrades include a dual mono setting in the Sonos app, allowing Amp to power multiple mono speakers where a stereo pair isnât available, so you donât get stuck hearing half the sound, as well as features like volume limiting and volume passthrough to allow the app to potentially control other audio devices. And thatâs just the tip of the smart-home iceberg. Sonos expects the opening of its cloud-based control API in September to unleash a swell of new features and functions. Integration of If This Then That (IFTTT) software will allow even novice partners to crack into the Sonos code and create custom applications. With the introduction of sound notifications to Sonos software, for instance, programmers could potentially integrate sound alerts from smart-home setups like security systems, smart locks, and even geofencing systems, which could do everything from starting your favorite playlist when you walk in the door to announcing your presence to the family before you even park your car in the driveway. A plan to open the Sonos software API to developers could be the key to unlocking all sorts of new features. New partnerships with smart-home companies like Crestron, Control4, Savant, and others are designed to help Sonos integrate its software into more complex smart-home systems for even more options. In addition, Sonos announced an intriguing new speaker partnership with custom speaker maker Sonance (no direct relation) for a new custom lineup of outdoor, in-wall, and in-ceiling wired speakers to utilize Sonosâ Trueplay speaker tuning softwareÂ for tailored sound in any environment. The company that pioneered the whole-home wireless speaker segment is no longer content to peddle its speakers and soundbars to the masses. With its latest device and its new open-ended software, Sonos is eyeing a bigger piece of the new smart-home revolution. The Sonos Amp goes on sale in February for $599, with dealer access beginning December 1.",0.024,0.866,0.11,0.9988

 Sonos shipped its very first productâthe ZP100 amplifierâway back in January 2005. It took a full 10 years before that amp was succeeded by the not-radically-different ZP120 (later rebranded as the Connect:Amp). And in December 2018, the Connect:Amp will finally be succeeded by the very different Sonos Amp. While the Sonos Amp is aimed primarily at custom installers, anyone will be able to purchase one direct from Sonos.com, and the device will be more generally available in February 2019. Itâs not an inexpensive component at $599. And to be clear, itâs not a powered speakerâitâs a standalone amp that youâll add passive loudspeakers to. But the demos I attended at Sonosâ Boston headquarters last week certainly whet my appetite for a full review. So, whatâs so exciting about an amplifier? Unlike the amplified speakers that Sonos has iterated over the past 10 years, the Sonos Amp letsÂ youÂ decide how a Sonos system ultimately sounds. Sonos has introduced bigger speakers, smaller speakers, cheaper speakers, pricier speakers, and soundbarsÂ of various sizes. But Amp is only the company's second designed-from-the-ground-up amplifier. And I say itâs about time the company gives consumers unlimited choices when it comes toÂ  building out their multi-room audio systems. With Sonos Amp, you can integrate bookshelf speakers, tower speakers, in-wall, in-ceiling, or outdoorâand from whichever brand strikes your fancy. And Amp is of course backward compatible with every other product in the Sonos arsenal, so you can use all of them on the same network (up to a maximum of 32 nodes, that is). The Sonos Amp is more than twice as powerful as the Connect:Amp it replaces, being a Class D amp that delivers 125 watts per channel into an 8-ohm load with both channels driven. Sonos says it delivers an impressive signal-to-noise ratio of 116dB, with total harmonic distortion of less than 0.1 percent. The amp is stable driving 4-ohm loads and can drive up to four speakers simultaneously, either two lefts and two rights or four monophonic channels. The Sonos Amp doesnât come with an onboard RIAA preamp, so youâll either need to provide one or use a turntable that has an onboard preamp. In a home theater application, the amp can take in a 5.1-channel soundtrack over HDMI ARC and mix it to 4.1 channels, creating a phantom center channel that I found impressive during a demo in which the Amp drove a pair of Bowers & Wilkins 702 S2 tower speakers in front, while a second Amp drove a pair of Sonance VP66R SST/SUR surround speakers mounted in the ceiling. The Amp can also be paired with the wireless Sonos Sub, and you can use any matched pair of Sonosâ wireless speakers (apart from its soundbar speakers, that is) for surrounds without needing a second Amp. If you have a very large home theater, you could even set up two subwoofers: A wireless Sonos Sub and a third-party powered sub hardwired to the Amp (the Amp connected to the TV, if you're using more than one).Â  The Ampâs industrial designâan 8.54-inch-square box with a concave top and a matte black finishâis attractive enough to leave out in the open, but it can also be installed in any conventional 19-inch-wide component rack (the Amp itself is 1.5 RUâ2.52 inchesâhigh). The Amp doesnât have rack ears or tabs, but it does have a standard M5 threaded mount on its bottom. And even though itâs passively cooled, you can stack several Amps on top of each other. To eliminate concerns over thermal problems arising from stacked Amps, Sonos designed the internal chassis to which all the major electrical components are mounted as a massive heatsink. Despite being passively cooled, with the primary vent at the top, you can stack multiple Amps (active cooling is recommended for dense rack installations).Â  In fact, Sonos showed 32 Amps expertly installed in a single rack. The rack itself, of course, was actively cooled, but I must tip my hat to the installer who did the work, Chris Yiakas with Kreative AV.Â The wiring was masterfully handled, and as Sonos Amp product manager Benji Rappaport put it, âThe rack is a manifestation of the craft of the custom installer.â The Ampâs front panel hosts touch controls for volume up/down, previous/next track, and play/pause. A defeatable LED indicates the Ampâs status. On the rear panel youâll find a pair of line-level analog RCA inputs, HDMI ARC (which can be used as an optical digital input with an adapter), and an auto-detecting RCA output for a powered subwoofer, with an adjustable crossover (50- to 110Hz). Two pairs of custom binding posts can accommodate 10- to 18AWG speaker wire. Removing these exposes holes into which you can insert conventional banana plugs. Thereâs also a pair of ethernet ports. If you wish to connect a turntable to the Amp, youâll need either a separate preamp or a turntable that has a preamp built in. The head of Sonosâ retail and commercial installed solutions group, Zack Kramer, explained the companyâs thinking on that point: âWe figure if youâre a [vinyl] enthusiast, you probably already have a preamp you like,â he said. âIf youâre just getting into this, youâre probably buying a turntable with an onboard preamp.â A Sonos Amp prototype in a clear enclosure with its binding posts [right] removed. As part of its focus on the custom installer market, Sonos announced a new partnership with Sonance, a speaker manufacturer specializing in architectural speakers (i.e., loudspeakers and subwoofers that are designed to be installed inside walls and ceilings, so that they virtually disappear into the architecture of the home). The deal has Sonos and Sonance collaborating on the design of three architectural speakers designed specifically for the Sonos Amp: an in-wall, an in-ceiling, and an outdoor model. These products will be launched in early 2019 and will be marketed and sold by Sonos. The companies expect to show prototypes at this weekâs CEDIA trade show in San Diego. After last weekâs demos, in a one-on-one interview with Sonosâ director of business development, Ryan Taylor, I asked for the umpteenth time when Sonos might move to support digital audio beyond 16-bit resolution and 48kHz sampling rates. The company has always been non-committal on this point, but I think this might be the last time I ask about it. âWeâve looked at it for a long time,â Taylor said. âWeâll do it when it moves the needle for the consumer. Weâve done a lot of research and found that around 20-bit resolution is where people can hear a difference.â (Good luck finding retail tracks encoded in 20-bit resolution.) But Taylor also said Sonos relies on the advice of its Sonos Sound Boardâa group of recording engineers and other audio professionalsâduring its product design stages. âWe do what the creators guide us to,â Taylor said, âwhat sounds âright.ââ Michael covers the smart-home, home-entertainment, and home-networking beats, working in the smart home he built in 2007.

The company today announced a new version of the Sonos Amp and a partnership with Sonance that will result in three architectural speakers — in-wall, in-ceiling and outdoor — that Sonos says will gain additional functionality when paired with a Sonos system. Sonos is also announcing upcoming Control APIs that the company says will make it easier to integrate Sonos into the ever-evolving smart home. This jibes with Sonos’ long-standing approach of working with other platforms to offer its customers as many services as possible. 
The new Amp allows owners to use traditional home audio speakers with a Sonos system. Connect a turntable or stream media with just the Amp and power a set of bookshelf speakers. According to the spec sheet, the Amp has enough power to push most high-end bookshelf speakers. The Amp replaces the Connect:Amp. The new version is more powerful, works with more platforms and is more expensive at $599 rather than $499. This new version outputs 125 watts per channel at 8 ohms; it can power four speakers instead of two. The additional power makes the Amp more versatile than its predecessor, too. Sonos says the Amp can be used to add stereo sound to a TV (thanks in part to HDMI Arc support) or add wireless rears to a Sonos theater setup. Or, two Amps can be used to add a complete surround sound system. Multiple Amp units can be stacked or mounted in a rack. The Amp works with AirPlay 2 and with Alexa when used in conjunction with an Amazon Alexa-enabled Sonos device like a Sonos One or Beam. With a product like the Amp, Sonos has a new offering for those customers looking to integrate the convenient Sonos line into their high-end home theater setup. That’s a serious market, too, and the company’s new partnership with Sonance shows Sonos is committed to addressing the home audio enthusiast while building products to compete with Apple and Amazon. Together, they will produce in-wall speakers that when used with a Sonos Amp will offer additional functionality. The company stopped short of detailing the added functionality. These speakers are set for an early 2019 release. This is Sonos’ first large announcement after going public on August 2.",0.008,0.927,0.065,0.9628

company is looking to its past as a way to do it. On the heels of its recent IPO, Sonos is unveiling a new product as well as upcoming software changes — including opening its platform to developers — to try to fit the lifestyle of the consumer and enthusiast alike. Called the Sonos Amp, the new product is a direct descendant of the ZP100 amplifier, originally released in 2005 as one of the companyâs very first products. The ZP100 later got a slight bump up with the Connect:Amp, a product largely untouched in nearly a decade. The new Sonos Amp was shown to a small group of journalists, including MobileSyrup, last week at the companyâs Boston office. After two years of extensive research and development, the company is lifting the veil just in time for a planned major presence at CEDIA Expo — a large home tech pro show happening next week in San Diego. âThe current Connect:Amp has been on the market for over a decade and it has served many users well,â said Benji Rappoport, a hardware product manager at Sonos that headed up the development of the new Amp, to the small group of media. âBut times are changing and things are evolving. What we see is that the world is really starting to embrace architectural sound in a new way, and this is an investment in living with sound in a way that fits your aesthetic.â The Sonos Amp will be available in December for $799 CAD to install partners and on Sonosâ website, with a wide release coming in February 2019. With Amp, the company is focusing heavily on its large custom install builder community to understand its needs for getting more power to more speakers with a cleaner design and modern technology. The Sonos Amp is designed with racks, stacking and stability in mind. Itâs about 6.7cm tall and passively cools itself without any fans. It can now handle four speakers instead of the two in the Sonosâ previous amp offerings, with 125 watts a channel into 8 Ohm. Peak output current is 31 amps with a signal-to-noise ratio of 116dB. The back has an HDMI ARC connection with removable binding posts that can be replaced with standard banana plugs. There is a subwoofer output that you can now control the crossover frequency between 50 and 110Hz, whereas before it was fixed to 80Hz. There is still an analog input as well, plus two ethernet ports that will now disable Wi-Fi automatically when something is plugged in (auto-disable is rolling out to other Sonos products, too). Sonos is also keeping in an infrared receiver, but itâs wrapped around the bottom for easy repeater placement. Software wise, the Sonos Amp is getting dual mono plus volume limiting — a software feature that will be rolling out to other Sonos products — that allows you to have a second volume slider in the app to set a peak max volume, in case you donât want to disturb neighbours or children. âListening to the customer and industry feedback, weâve incorporated it into something that we think really is a meaningful upgrade and change to the experience,â said Ryan Taylor, Sonosâ director of business development, in an interview. âWe intentionally donât do tiny little upgrades on hardware. We do that all through software, which lets us keep a product like Connect:Amp in the market for 10 years.â “The default point of view is that everything should always get everything, unless it canât” The new Sonos Amp essentially marks the first time the company will be replacing a product, albeit a decade later. The companyâs strategy has never been to increase revenue through forcing customers to buy smaller iterations, like many tech hardware companies do, but instead the hope that people will keep expanding their Sonos collection by adding more speakers to the home. This means keeping the older models relevant for as long as it possibly can, the company said. Even the Connect:Amp will continue to get software updates after the new Amp comes out. âThe default point of view is that everything should always get everything, unless it canât,â Taylor said. âKeeping the hardware fresh enough to keep up with all of the modern software improvements (such as voice control or APIs) has been a shift,â added Zack Kramer, Sonosâ global head of retail and commercial installed solutions. âWhen we launched Connect:Amp, there wasnât Spotify. You probably had a flip phone. So when trying to keep the processing power and memory of 2008 current with what is happening with 2018, eventually you reach the natural limit.â The Amp is clearly aimed with home technology professionals in mind. The company announced new ways to receive direct feedback quickly from the professional community to understand what needs there are — both in design and features — then ultimately passing down the benefits to the homeowner that hires a custom builder to integrate everything. Sonos also announced a new partnership with Sonance, a company that specializes in speakers that are installed directly into the home. In early 2019 there will be co-branded in-ceiling, in-wall and outdoor speakers that will use Sonosâ Trueplay technology for better sound quality. âNow there is this piece of hardware (Amp) thatâs this swiss army knife that you can use with so many different speakers, TVs and things in your home to get the best sound available,â Kramer said. “There are pretty good use cases around this becoming a replacement for the traditional old way of doing amplified sound for a turntable.” âThereâs really no need to choose how you listen out loud in your home anymoreâ¦ Whether itâs through your voice, TV, standalone speakers, or outdoors, there is a way to have Sonos do all of that for you and will play really nicely with the rest of the home.â The new Sonos Amp offers some compelling use case for not just professionals, but also for consumers and audiophiles who want to build a sound system for themselves. Media visiting the Sonos office in Boston was given a demo of a vinyl player with built-in pre-amp hooked up to the companyâs upcoming Amp, then connected through speaker wire to a pair of large floor speakers. There was also a second Sonos Amp in the mix that was hooked up to rear ceiling speakers and a Sonos subwoofer to demo some action scenes on a big screen TV. The Sonos Amp, thanks to its increased power, could pump out an impressive amount of sound that gave the speakers a wide amount of range without clipping or distortion, plus you could hear the small details more clearly in both the movies and the music. âThere are pretty good use cases around this becoming a replacement for the traditional old way of doing amplified sound for a turntable,â Taylor said. âThe other thing is there is a really big opportunity to retrofit existing stuff with new Sonosâ¦ For example, putting in a Sonos Beam and connecting an Amp to the (speakers) already wired into your new house. Thatâs a really strong use case for Amp that is accessible.â In addition to new hardware, Sonos is announcing a new program that will let any software developer create for the companyâs platform. Previously only select developers were invited to use various APIs and integrate Sonos within their apps but starting in September any developer can log on the website and receive tools such SDKs, APIs, helpful documentation, Sonos Sound Experience guidelines and the ability to give direct feedback to Sonos. âThe rise of the smart home, streaming services and voice interaction has really allowed a wave of users to be using smart speakers in their home,â Lidiane Jones, Sonosâ vice president of software product management, told media during the Boston event. âWe already use this platform for the integration that we do with Amazon, Apple, Spotify and a number of these partnersâ¦ and hopefully in a year we are going to be discussing all of these interesting new integrations that are coming out that we canât even predict today.â “Clearly all of the home automation and smart home use cases are interesting, but Iâm much more interested in the stuff I canât really envision yet.â In September, the platform will give developers new APIs for things such as core playback controls, grouping, play mode, line-in switching, volume pass-through, maximum volume limits and access to music playlists users create within the Sonos app. Meanwhile, coming in October will be a feature called Audio Clip, which is essentially a notification API that will let developers insert a sound after pausing the audio and then resume it afterward. Also coming in September will be IFTTT integration for sets of tasks. One hypothetical example given was a geofence so the platform will know to play a specific Sonos playlist when you come home on a specific day of the week or after a certain time. âWe donât know what we are going to see, which is the most exciting part,â Taylor said. âClearly all of the home automation and smart home use cases are interesting, but Iâm much more interested in the stuff I canât really envision yet.â Sonosâ platform-agnostic approach to its physical products has already created an ecosystem that is compatible with many different services and operating systems. The company is hoping that by making its platform open to everyone in September will mean all developers, big or small, will start creating for it and make it much more useful and creative. âLaunching something thatâs open also becomes an accountability to Sonos because we are going to be publicly updating and delivering new APIs,â Jones said. âWe were cautious to do that because we wanted to make sure that we had a roadmap that is robust with new capabilities coming regularly. So thatâs a commitment to the developer community: that we are going to build on this platform.â  Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Reddit Related Articles Aug 2, 2018 6:32 PM EDT Aug 2, 2018 11:30 AM EDT Aug 9, 2018 2:52 PM EDT Comments Categories Contact us Social Newsletter Signup Thank you for your subscription   © 2018 mobilesyrup.com Privacy.

If you've got a HomePod (or two) you can finally take advantage of the upcoming features. If you're wondering how AirPlay 2 works with HomePod or with third-party Airplay-supported speakers, keep on reading. It's a new feature in iOS 11.4 that lets you send audio to multiple AirPlay speakers at once, from anywhere in iOS. This lets you assemble a multiroom audio system from any compatible speakers, and control it from iOS's AirPlay controls or inside third-party apps. If you have any HomeKit devices, you're probably already using the Home app. Now you'll be able to add speakers to the rooms of your home, and then they'll show up in your iPhone or iPad's AirPlay controls as Living Room, Bedroom, Tree House, Man Cave, and so on. Yes, once you upgrade to tvOS 11.4, your Apple TV can send audio to speakers around your home as well. You could put your party playlist on the Apple TV's Music app, play it on the living room speakers plus out on the deck, and control it with the Apple TV remote or iOS app—or with Siri. Well, the first thing you'll need to do is make sure all of your HomePod speakers are updated to HomePod 11.4, which is the software update that includes AirPlay 2 support. You'll only see AirPod 11.4 after you've updated your connected iPhone to 11.4 or newer, and if you're hoping to sync up your dual HomePods to your Apple TV, you'll have to be running tvOS 11.4, so make sure all of your software is up to date. How to update your HomePod software After both speakers have been updated, open the details of one of the HomePods in the Home app and tap Create Stereo Pair to pair the two speakers together. Then select a second HomePod to connect them together. You'll then be asked to identify which HomePod is on the left side of the room and which is on the right. Tap on each one to make sure they're playing the right channel. If they're backward, tap the orange swap button to switch them. Tap Back once you've confirmed their set up. The two HomePods will now be in a group identified by which room they are in. Because each HomePod houses its own A8 processor chip, it will provide separate left and right audio channels for true stereo sound when both HomePods are in the same room. It's kind of like magic, except it's anything but magic because a lot of people worked very hard to make this a reality. Syncing up is perfect. I can stand in any spot in the room and not even realize both HomePods are playing music, and I mean that in a good way. They both fill out the room perfectly without any overlap or lag. It's as if they are hardwired to my stereo. If you are playing tunes through two different HomePods and they're not paired in a group, you can either ask Siri to control playback and it will trigger on both AirPods or you can control playback and volume (individually or together) from Control Center. When you pause audio, it stops in both rooms. When you play, it plays, with scalpel precision, the exact same moment in the track without even the slightest lag. If you've grouped multiple HomePods in one ""room,"" meaning they're synced to always play at the same time in the same room without the ability to separate what is being played, volume controls, and the like, and you move one of the grouped HomePods into a different room, you'll still be able to have audio play perfectly in sync, but you will only be able to trigger Siri commands or Control Center playback from one of the HomePods. By default, this is the left HomePod, but you can switch the default to the right HomePod by long-pressing on the touchscreen on top. This is actually a very easy way to use Siri on a different HomePod if the two are grouped and you happen to want to take a different one into another room. Just long press on the touchscreen and then ask Siri anything. You can switch back by long-pressing the left HomePod touchscreen anytime you'd like. Not even a little. Once you've paired your HomePods into a group and identified which is the left and which is the right, they're synced up and running like they are hardwired to your stereo or Apple TV. Whether you play, pause, fast forward or rewind, both speaker act in tandem with each without any hesitation every single time. I tried a couple of different tests with Siri and Control Center to play content with grouped HomePods creating a stereo sound and they never failed me. I've played audio tracks that play separate sounds between the right and left channels and can confirm that they are set up like a set of stereo speakers, not like two mono speakers playing the same thing at the same time. As far as sound is concerned. Yes. Having a single HomePod is fantastic and really fills a room. When connected to Apple TV, however, I sometimes have to turn up the audio to the max in order to hear a movie at what I would consider ""loud."" Having two HomePods, both connected to my Apple TV, makes the audio really fill the room and doesn't require me to be at full volume in order to get a serious sound set up. Dual HomePods has definitely solved my volume issues. As for connections issues... I've had a single HomePod connected to my Apple TV since day one. It's my main use for HomePod. To my great annoyance, my HomePod disconnects from my Apple TV all of the time — like, nearly every day. Will having two HomePods fix that? Probably not, but I'm hoping that HomePod 11.4's software update includes secret stability support to fix the problem. I haven't been using the dual HomePod connection long enough to know for sure if it's fixed or not. I'll let you know when it's been a few days. Yes! As of August 29, Apple has added AirPlay 2 support for AirPort Express! Make sure you've updated your firmward to v. 7.8. Once you update and plug in any audio system, it'll join the list of available sources. Then it's just a matter of invoking Siri, or tapping the interface, to tell it to play. Sonos does support AirPlay 2 on four of its speakers: Sonos One, Sonos Beam, Sonos PlayBase, and the second-generation Play:5. As for other third-party speaker companies, support has been rolling out throughout the year. Apple's AirPlay support page lists the following speakers (in addition to HomePod) that either have or will receive an update to support AirPlay 2: This is not the entire list of brands that will support AirPlay 2. On Apple's info page, there are additional companies, like Beats, BlueSound, Bose, Bowers & Wilkins, and more, that have pledged support for some of their speakers. Do you have any questions about AirPlay 2? Let me know and I'll find out everything I can for you.

 Zac Hall writing for 9to5Mac: 
Appleâs AirPort line may be discontinued, but AirPort Express got one heck of an update today. Firmware update 7.8 for the latest AirPort Express hardware (2012 2nd-gen model, no longer sold) adds support for AirPlay 2 and Appleâs Home app.
 If youâre like me, one feature holding you back from switching from a Sonos system to the HomePod is the ability to connect to external speakers. With my Sonos Connect, Iâm able to hook my Sonos system into the ceiling speakers in my home, and play the same music over my ceiling speakers and my standalone Sonos. I pondered how Iâd do this with the HomePod. It looks like this update fills that gap, since the AirPort Express has a port to connect to external speakers, and can now sync with the HomePod. Now the only obstacle for me is the price of switching systems, and getting the AirPort Express properly configured to not broadcast a network. Next post Previous post

Returns as of 8/30/2018 Yesterday, Samsung's Harman Kardon announcedÂ a new $600 smart speaker called the Citation 500 that will integrate Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Assistant. Today, Bose unveiled a trio of new products, including Bose Home Speaker 500, a Soundbar 700, and Soundbar 500 -- all of which integrate Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa. Those are just each company's latest gadgets. Harman Kardon launchedÂ an Alexa-powered speaker called Allure last year, shortly before Bose added support for Google Assistant to the second-generation version of its popular QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones (which also just receivedÂ Alexa support earlier this month). The growing number of third-party integrations that Google Assistant and Alexa are receiving will only expand their lead over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The new Alexa-powered Bose Home Speaker 500. Image source: Bose. Market researchers Strategy Analytics and Canalys recently released estimates on the global smart speaker market in the second quarter, and while they differed on who was No. 1 and who was No. 2, both agreed that Amazon and Google are dominating the market. The two giants combined commanded 69% of the market, according to Strategy Analytics, or about 57% in Canalys' estimation. However, those estimates for unit volumes and market share only consider the first-party devices that Amazon and Google sell. If you include all of the third-party smart speakers that integrate Google Assistant, Alexa, or both, then the reach of those voice assistant platforms gets even bigger. Sonos, which recently went public, is also transitioning its product portfolio, starting with the Sonos One released last year and more recently the Sonos Beam, both of which integrate Alexa. As of the first quarter, Sonos had sold over 4.6 million products on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, accordingÂ to its prospectus. The product mix is unclear, but the company does attribute its volume growth to the Sonos One. At this point, most of the prominent high-end audio players are aggressively working to include third-party virtual assistants in order to capture some of the incredible growth that the product category is currently enjoying. In contrast, Apple is pursuing a familiar strategy of strict hardware-software integration. Siri is widely considered less capable than Alexa and Google Assistant, but third-party manufacturers don't even have the option to integrate it if they wanted to. It's worth acknowledging that some major improvements are coming for Siri in iOS 12, including a new Shortcuts app that will allow users to automate common tasks and create customized workflows. But within the smart speaker market, those improvements will only benefit HomePod owners. While Apple was the first to launch a virtual assistant, Amazon was the first to open up its virtual assistant to third-party developers, turning it into a vibrant platform full of third-party innovation. Apple was right to recognize the potential of voice-powered interfaces in enabling new computing platforms, which led it to acquire Siri in 2010, a deal pushed by ex-software chief Scott Forstall. But in the years since, Siri has taken a back seat to rivals. Can it ever catch up?  John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

In the past year weâve seen a number of high-end AI-speaker systems hit the market, including the Sonos One and the Apple HomePod. However, even with these new entries, there was still a noticeable absence left by one of the biggest names in home audio: Bose.
 Today, Bose is introducing a new line of speakers consisting of the Home Speaker 500, the Sound Bar 500 and the Sound Bar 700, which are the companyâs first speakers to have built-in smart speaker functionality.  Previously, in order to get voice commands on a Bose, you had to do things like connect a Bose SoundlinL to an Echo Dot, which was not only kind of clunky, but also didnât really stick to Boseâs design philosophy of making sophisticated self-contained audio systems.  So in addition to adding support for Amazon Alexa to its new speaker, Bose also engineered the Home Speaker 500 to deliver what the company says is true stereo audio separation without the need for multiple units. Now of course, if you have a really big room to fill, you can still pair the Home Speaker 500 with a second device to pump out extra sound. And as youâd expect from a device that costs $US400 ($546), the Home Speaker 500 comes with eight mics sporting near and far-field mic technology to help the speaker hear you even when your music is blaring. Thereâs even a little LCD screen in front so you can see album art and other things from across the room. However, the one thing Iâm not quite sold on is the Home Speaker 500's looks. Yes, I know that Bose audio systems have never been particularly sleek or elegant, but this thing looks like a weird mix between a Sonos One and a HomePod that was somehow crafted in the late 2000s. As for Boseâs new soundbars, you can choose between the smaller and less expensive Soundbar 500 which is 79cm long and starts at $US550 ($751), or go for the more premium Soundbar 700, which measures 97cm, cost $US800 ($1092), and comes with its own universal remote.  Both soundbars feature Boseâs custom low-profile transducers, an HDMI audio return channel,Â automatic Adaptiq sound tuning for easy setup, and support for full 5.1 surround sound through the addition of a wireless subwoofer.  With these three new speakers, it nice to see Bose catch on to one of the hottest trends in audio, but I still wish the Home Speaker 500 looked a little less chintzy. All three speakers should be available in the US in October. Australian pricing and availability has not yet been confirmed.",0.008,0.883,0.109,0.993

Today, the company stepped even further into the forefront of home audio, offering a first for the brand in a newÂ smart speakerÂ to add to the ever-expanding genre. In addition, the company has two new smart soundbars, aiming to turn some heads and take some attention away from multiroom wireless company Sonos and its new Beam soundbar. Each new option from the company will be fully voice-controllable, featuring Amazon Alexa integration from the get-go, and according to Bose, other voice assistants to follow with software updates down the line (read Google Assistant). In addition, the company says that Airplay 2 integration will be added in early 2019 to go along with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built-in. Bose is calling its new smart speaker the Home Speaker 500. A small device that looks strikingly similar to the litany of oval pods in the market from Sonos and others, the Home Speaker 500 differs from many competitors in that it offers a screen on the front that displays what’s currently playing. We expect the display to do more than just that, but since Bose hasn’t revealed all it can do, we’ll keep our speculation to ourselves for now. The speaker is also a stereo device, which should make music playback more lifelike than the mono sound of most competitors, though at this size, we don’t exactly expect a wide stereo image. Outside the display screen, perhaps the most notable thing about the Home Speaker 500 at this point is its price. At $400, the speaker outdoes even Apple’s HomePod when it comes to premium pricing for a smart speaker, and costs double the price of the Sonos One smart speaker, though it does appear to be a fair bitÂ bigger. At that price, the 500 will have to impress in multiple categories — including offering some excellent sound — to turn people to Bose’s answer to the smart-speaker category. The soundbars, called the Soundbar 500 and Soundbar 700, are simple and elegant looking devices with Bose’s signature industrial design flair. The main difference between the two new products is their size: The Soundbar 700 is 2 inches high by 4 inches deep, and is 38 inches long, where the Soundbar 500 is a quarter inch shorter and just over 31 inches long. Both bars employ Bose PhaseGuide technology, which is designed to create clear, directional sound. Custom low-profile transducers and the company’s QuietPort tech are designed to enable solid detail and a beefy low end from soundbars their size. Both also feature ARC for compatibility with smart TVs, which opens up the possibility of voice control for some basic TV functions, but do not come with subwoofer companion speakers. In addition, both bars also come with Bose’s ADAPTiQ tech — digital signal processing software designed to acoustically adjust the sound of the speakers to the room in which they are placed. “Voice-controlled speakers arenât new, and there are plenty of great options to choose from. But we had a different vision for ours, inspired by what we could uniquely do to make the experience better,â said BoseÂ consumer electronics division manager Doug Cunningham in a press release. âAll of our new smart speakers double up on functionality. It takes just one Home Speaker 500 to deliver true stereo separation â thereâs no need to pair two. Our Soundbar 700 and 500 are thin and discreet with jaw-dropping surround sound â whether youâre streaming Spotify or watching a movie. They combine Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for unbeatable ease of use, can be mixed and matched to play in sync or separately, and with new Alexa functionality and more VPAs on the way, theyâll only get better over time.â As mentioned, the Home Speaker 500 is priced at $400, while the Soundbar 500 and 700 also come in on the high side, priced at $550 and $800, respectively.

There are three products in the new Bose networked sound range and all will ship with Alexa voice support, with âother voice assistants to followâ according to Bose executives. Each has an eight-microphone array for far-field voice recognition with the US company claiming that AirPlay 2 functionality will be added in early 2019. Called the Bose Home Speaker 500 the top model comes with a small display so that you can see what content is being played. Bose claims the new 500 speaker delivers âthe widest soundstage of any smart speaker available today.â The new speaker is encased in aluminium which houses two custom drivers that âpoint in opposite directions”. Bose have designed it this way so that the sound reflects off surrounding walls, separating instruments to the far left and right, and placing vocals where the artist did.â On the top of the device are several buttons for controlling playback. There are also six pre-set numbers for accessing your favourite playlists, internet radio stations and your own content. You can not only mute Alexa voice there is also a jack for plugging in headphones. Six weeks after Sonos released their small struggling Beam Soundbar, Bose has released a premium 700 soundbar. All of the new Bose products are set to be on sale at JB Hi Fi by the last quarter with staff set to recommend the Bose offering over the Sonos offering due in part to Sonos moving to sell online in competition with their retailers. Bose engineers claim that the 700 âwas engineered to outperform every other product in its category. Measuring 5 centimetres high, 10.1 centimetres deep, and 96.5 centimetres long, thereâs a metal grille running around it with a tempered glass plate on top. The cheaper version of the new Bose offering is the 500 Soundbar. This device is smaller, thinner, and has a matte finish. Both of the Bose soundbars include HDMI ARC support. They also feature Boseâs âADAPTiQâ tech for automatically making audio optimizations based on a roomâs sound characteristics. Last, Bose says they âcan be wall-mounted or expanded with a wireless bass module and rear speakers for a full 5.1 experience.â The release by Bose of a competing product range is bad news for Sonos who are facing a backlash from analysts who see several audio brands now delivering superior networked audio products to the US Company. Bose claim that their speakers âwork brilliantly alone or together as a multi-room system,â which is another clear indication of what competitors Bose has in mind. Multi-room playback isnât new for Bose; the companyâs home speakers have been doing it for a while. But this is the companyâs latest push to go up against Sonos, Amazon, Google, Apple, and other companies that offer the capability with their speakers.   02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

 Bose today showed off a new smart speaker and pair of soundbars powered by Amazonâs digital assistant Alexa as it battles other high-end speaker makers like Sonos. Bose paints the new speaker lineup, set to be released in October, as the ânext chapter in its legendary home audio history.â Bose boasts that each device âcrushes the limitations of spaciousness from a single enclosure.â In its announcement, Bose said the speakers and soundbars will come with WiFi and Alexa built in, with âother voice assistants to follow, and AirPlay 2 for simple streaming from Apple devices added in early 2019.â âVoice-controlled speakers arenât new, and there are plenty of great options to choose from.

It sells for $200. Amazon had dominated sales of connected speakers since  launching in 2014. But this year, Google's copycat Home speaker has surpassed Amazon in market share statistics, outshipping sales of Echo speakers in the first two quarters, according to researcher Canalys. The Voicebot.ai website, which tracks the connected speaker market, suggests that Amazon's sales may have started to fall because so many members of Amazon's Prime expedited shipping and entertainment offeringÂ already have the speaker. ""This means that Amazonâs core customer base is approaching saturation in smart speaker ownership,"" Voicebot's Bret Kinsella wrote.Â  Â  Google has helped goose its market share by lowering prices. The entry-level Google Home Mini, similar to the Dot, sells for $39.99, the same price as the Dot.Â But with the holidays around the corner, look for the Dot and Mini, as well as all the current speakers, to be heavily discounted.Â  If you're hooked on AlexaÂ and want to use the assistant for playing music, weather reports and podcastsÂ and keeping up with all things Amazon, you'llÂ probably want an Echo.Â  The Dot is far and away the best sellerÂ thanks to the size and price, but we like the classic Echo and itsÂ more robust speaker. Home automation is a cool concept, if you're willing to take the time and potential expense to set up with your system. And video is always welcome. But the selection Amazon has is missing one huge component â YouTube, due to a spat with corporate owner Google.Â  Meanwhile, if great sound is what youâre after, the best place to find Alexa is on the Sonos One speaker, which sells for $199Â and really rocks. We found the Sonos One discounted to $150 for the holidays, which means it will probably be discounted again in the coming weeks. Whatâs your favorite Echo speaker?

The company just announced three new products to lead these efforts, and they include the Bose Home Speaker 500, Bose Soundbar 700, and Bose Soundbar 500. The Home Speaker 500 is Bose's answer to products like the Google Home, Sonos One, and Apple Homepod. It's equipped with eight microphones for Alexa voice commands (other assistants are coming later on), two custom drivers are said to provide ""wall-to-wall stereo sound,"" and there's an array of buttons on the top for controlling your playback, opening your favorite music service, and more. You see that screen? Yeah, it's not a touchscreen. It just shows album artwork. Along with the (likely) exceptional audio experience, the Home Speaker 500 also stands out thanks to the small display on its front. This is not a touchscreen and doesn't have any UI to navigate. Instead, its sole purpose is to showcase the album artwork of whatever you're listening to. While there's not much utility there, it does give the Home Speaker 500 a visual difference over its competitors. As for the Bose Soundbar 700 and Soundbar 500, these are also powered by Alexa and come with eight microphone arrays, too. The 700 is the more powerful of the duo and is 2-inches tall, 4-inches deep, and has a length of 38 inches. Bose is touting room-filling sound for both, in addition to ADAPTiQ technology that senses the layout of your room to provide the best possible audio.  All three gadgets are launching this October with the following prices: You can use these gadgets by themselves, but just like another speaker company that also has smart speakers and smart soundbars, Bose's new gadgets can also be used simultaneously and controlled through the Bose Connect app. The new speaker and soundbars definitely seem to be designed to attract people away from the Sonos ecosystem, but with considerably higher prices compared to what Sonos is offering, how will Bose's efforts play out?

45,Mike Waldron,Personalized AI assistants to help make life that much easier.,2018-08-28 16:01:15,,A Complete Guide to The Best Home Smart Speakers,http://hiconsumption.com/2018/08/guide-to-the-best-home-smart-speakers/,http://cdn.hiconsumption.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Guide-to-Best-Smart-Speakers-0-Hero.jpg,"Apple HomePod The year 2014 was a pivotal moment in the world of home audio. For it was the year Amazon shook up the market with the release of the Echo. With it, homeowners were suddenly presented with a real-life personal assistant ready to keep tabs on  shopping lists, make purchases, play music, stay up to date on the latest news stories, and even control home lighting with a simple command. Like a contemporary genie granting simple wishes within reason, these tableside companions were embraced quickly by smart home enthusiasts the world over. And now, just four years later, the smart speaker market has expanded greatly with the likes of Siri, Google Assistant, and Cortana joining in with Alexa to provide first-class service at a momentâs notice. Just like any other product dynamic, however, with choices come opportunity â or peril â that depends heavily on ensuring the smart speaker you choose best fits your purposes, whatever that may be. So, because we understand the importance of such decision making, what follows is a brief guide to the best smart speakers currently available. These range from Siri to Alexa to Google in their capabilities, each offering the same idea at its core, but accomplishing that idea in unique ways.  The Future is Now Toward the end of 2017, NPR and Edison Research published a report claiming upward of 39 million Americans â or 16% of the U.S. population â owned a smart speaker of some kind. Mind you, this is a mere three years since the first smart speaker was introduced by Amazon. And in the short time since then, weâve seen Apple, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, and Samsung all pitch in and join the party. But where did it all start? And whatâs the intended purpose/implications of catering to such an on-demand lifestyle? Well, while that is what some would call a loaded question, weâll do our best to address the answer as briefly as possible. To start, if weâre to address voice-assistants in general â speakers aside â we see that it was back in 1962 when IBM introduced the very first digital speech recognition tool dubbed the IBM Shoebox. And over the decades that followed, Microsoft introduced their speech recognition feature for Office XP, Apple unleashed Siri into the world via the iPhone, Google Now dropped in 2012, and Cortana was introduced at a developer conference in April of 2013. Then in November of 2014, as stated above, Amazon released Alexa as the first portable smart speaker for the home. And from there, well, you get the idea. As for the second half of the question, it would appear that just like any other technological advancement weâve seen, the intended purpose is that of convenience. On-demand music, controlling your smart home with your voice, keeping tabs on intended purchases â basically handling the menial day-to-day tasks weâd rather outsource than take care of ourselves is what makes smart speakers so special.  Who's Right For You? With three big players in this space, we can say thereâs some much-needed deliberation to determine which AI system is best suited for your needs and expectations. Itâs from here where weâll work to compare them using a litmus test complete with what we consider as the primary differentiators between them. That is, voice recognition, making phone calls, music services, general interaction, and smart home connectivity/integration. Starting with the basics, voice recognition is dominated by both Alexa and Google Assistant smart speakers in that they boast voice differentiating capabilities, unlike Appleâs HomePod. Meaning, anyone who drops a âHey Siri,â will get a response from the device â which could be a good or bad thing really â while voice recognition with Alexa could prevent any unwanted purchases/shopping list additions. Much-needed deliberation is needed in order to determine which AI system is best suited for your individual needs. Next up? Making phone calls. And while most of us would use our smartphones for this sort of task, nothing really beats an on-demand call from your smart speaker. However, out of the three options, only Google Assistant speakers can dial out while Alexa can only receive calls. HomePod canât do either, though you can use the device to send text messages to friends and family. All three can also be used as speakers for phone calls made on your smartphone. A little mix and match between the three but helpful in their own ways nonetheless. And what about music? Possibly the most sought after or utilized feature for smart speakers, integrated streaming services for smart speakers is a huge bonus â it just depends on which service youâre after. Apple, for example, works to keep you in their ecosystem by only offering streaming via Apple-approved music services. Alexa and Google Assistant, however, allow for syncing of third-party music services like Spotify without any issues. Not all is lost though. For if you wish to play a Spotify song through the HomePod device, you can via their Airplay service. Youâd just have to manage everything from a smartphone. Finally, for those looking to streamline other smart devices in their home, each of the âBig Threeâ smart speakers has benefits and limitations to consider. Regarding the HomePod, as long as each of your smart home devices are HomeKit products, the setup and linkage for this is insanely simple since the HomePod automatically receives your preferences and device info during the setup process. What results is a âHey Siri, turn on the lightsâ protocol that many will find enjoyable. The HomeKit lineup is just limited in nature so the versatility here is as well. As for Alexa and Google Assistant, youâll need invocation words to interact with devices outside of the ecosystem such as having Alexa ask the other smart device for a status or task. Not ideal, we know, but with a larger library of compatible options, it is a solid workaround to say the least.  The Best Smart Speakers On The Market Now to the good stuff: the best smart speakers currently on the market. For this, we felt it beneficial to scour the market for all options â including those speakers outside the individual brand lineup like the HomePod, Echo, etc. Donât get us wrong though, for we did include and support those options; we just wanted to expand the lineup so to speak.  With Amazon Alexa built right into the speakerâs interface, Sonos not only offers a premium listening experience but convenience youâd expect from Amazon. Here, play music on demand, remain updated with local and international news cycles, and control your smart home. The device also seamlessly connects with other Sonos Home Sounds System speakers for multi-room listening and hosts incredible sound thanks to a set of Class-D amplifiers and custom-built drivers for good measure. Purchase: $199   Compatible with Google Assistant, JBL offers the same portable sound quality as previous iterations but now with a little hands-free voice control. Nothing beats a portable personal assistant, which is why we fell in love with the Link 20. Enjoy far-field voice recognition, simple setup with the Google Home app, and additional features like built-in Chromecast, high-quality 24 bit sound, multi-room playback, Bluetooth streaming, and 10 hours of playtime per charge. Purchase: $150  In addition to the Sonos One, the Sonos Beam adds some serious sound quality to the home entertainment system. With it, upgrade your music listening, movie watching, and video-game-playing experience to professional quality. And with Alexa integrated seamlessly into the device, enjoy on-demand Fire TV remote-free control as well. We all know a home theater system is an end-game status to achieve, and fortunately, the Beam is here to facilitate just that. Purchase: $399  Ideal for the kitchen, the Echo Show offers everything you enjoy about the standard Echo but now with a visual aid. Need to access some instructional videos for cooking up that five-star meal? Not a problem. You can also make video calls on the fly if your hands are busy, access security cameras around the home, and connect with other Echo devices around the home for total control from the hungriest room in the homestead. Purchase: $130   The big boy for the Google Home operating system, this smart speaker is built to turn your home into an arena-quality sound-infused party thanks to the likes of acoustically transparent fabric, dual 4.5â woofers, and custom tweeters for clear highs. And letâs not forget the helpful nature of the device â this is a Google Assistant after all â so just ask it for help and youâll be granted. Purchase: $399  The second generation of the smart speaker that started it all, it was impossible to not include the Echo in this list. Anyone even vaguely interested in purchasing a smart speaker is somewhat familiar with this device but to cover the basics, Alexa can learn hundreds of individual âskillsâ to help make life a bit less complicated. Also, we canât forget about Echoâs ability to play music, make calls, set timers, ask questions, and control smart home devices on the fly. Purchase: $85  The newest member to the party, Apple just couldnât help but bring Siri into the mix with the HomePod. Think most of the capabilities offered on the mobile version but with better sound quality and a more streamlined experience housed within a design-forward speaker that looks good in any room. Each device comes equipped with Bluetooth 5.0, multi-room speaker support with AirPlay 2, and instant connectivity to other HomeKit smart home devices. Not a bad addition to the Apple ecosystem if you ask us. Purchase: $349  With a little help from Google Assistant, Lenovo developed this appropriate response to the Amazon Echo Show. Itâs with the Smart Display that all the benefits of Googleâs AI come to life for your enjoyment. Weâre talking features such as visualized alerts, how-to videos for the amateur chefs, connection to other in-home cameras, and hands-free video calling in addition to â you guessed it â a streamlined music-playing experience. By now we should have you sold that a hands-free life is something worth pursuing. And with the Lenovo Smart Display, weâre offered a solid step in the right direction. Purchase: $199  It's All About Your Ecosystem A little long-winded weâll admit, but weâre hoping this has helped a bit in your smart speaker search. Needless to say, one major takeaway is understanding the limitations each device offers along with how each piece would best suites the needs of your home. Not fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem? Weâd suggest steering away from the HomePod. On the other hand, Alexa and Google Assistant devices allow for broader compatibility with other products making for a more user-friendly experience across the board. Again, this is all about preference. Our advice? If you’re looking for Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant compatible speakers outside of the brand lineup, opt for quality and don’t skimp for budgetary options. It’s also important to realize this is just the beginning. For as smart speakers continue to gain popularity, the user interface, experience, and product offerings will continue to improve as well. Todayâs market is formidable and key brands understand the potential here, so thereâs really only one possible outcome to consider in the near future. And itâs looking quite bright.  With a smart speaker comes a stylish home. And for that, we have you covered with the 30Â best online furniture stores to get the homestead decked out properly.

However, even with all these new entries, there was still a noticeable absence left by one of the biggest names in home audio: Bose.  Today, Bose is introducing a new line speakers consisting of the Home Speaker 500, the Sound Bar 500, and the Sound Bar 700, which are the companyâs first speakers to have built-in smart speaker functionality. Previously, in order to get voice commands on a Bose, you had to do stuff like connect a Bose SoundlinL to an Echo Dot, which was not only kind of clunky, but also didnât really stick to Boseâs design philosophy of making sophisticated self-contained audio systems.  Advertisement  So in addition to adding support for Amazon Alexa to its new speaker, Bose also engineered the Home Speaker 500 to deliver what the company says is true stereo audio separation without the need for multiple units. Now of course, if youâve got a really big room to fill, you can still pair the Home Speaker 500 with a second device to pump out extra sound. And as youâd expect from a device that costs $400 (the same as a HomePod), the Home Speaker 500 comes with eight mics sporting near and far-field mic technology to help the speaker hear you even when your music is blaring. Thereâs even a little LCD screen in front so you can see album art and other things from across the room. However, the one thing Iâm not quite sold on is the Home Speaker 500's looks. Yes, I know that Bose audio systems have never been particularly sleek or elegant, but this thing looks like a weird mix between a Sonos One and a HomePod that was somehow crafted in the late 2000s. Advertisement  As for Boseâs new soundbars, you can choose between the smaller and less expensive Soundbar 500 which is 31-inches long and starts at $550, or go for the more premium Soundbar 700, which measures 38-inches, cost $800, and comes with its own universal remote.  Both soundbars feature Boseâs custom low-profile transducers, an HDMI audio return channel,Â  automatic Adaptiq sound tuning for easy setup, and support for full 5.1 surround sound through the addition of a wireless subwoofer.  Advertisement  With these three new speakers, it nice to see Bose catch on to one of the hottest trends in audio, but I still wish the Home Speaker 500 looked a little less chintzy. All three speakers should be available later in fall in October.  Senior reporter at Gizmodo, formerly Tom's Guide and Laptop Mag.

He described the company's central design ethos in simple terms: ""It's all about great quality solutions for every Sonos product, giving Sonos users more options for the placement and use of their Sonos speakers."" Every brand needs to have a coherent industrial design, and with a real variety of products, from wall mounts to desk stands to extension cables it can be difficult to make them all recognisable as Flexson products? Sevdali explained, ""Our UK design team follows Flexson brand values, which include a focus on providing premium-but-functional solutions that are styled to complement every Sonos product."" Ah, yes, of course it's crucial that the Flexson products look like they go with the Sonos speakers, too, so how does Sevdali settle on colours they might want to use? ""It's simple really, we work hard to colour-match to the Sonos product so our accessory seamlessly integrates with it. On occasion we add accent materials and finishes such as the Oak and Walnut real wood used on our Premium Floor Stands, which give the products a luxurious feel. This has the helpful side-effect of matching other real-wood furniture finishes customers are likely to have at home. So much for colours, what about materials? Sevdali is meticulous in making sure the products look right in material terms, too. ""We only use high-quality materials and finishes that complement the Sonos speakers, and ensure they're properly supported. There are cheaper options, but we work to higher standards."" The design process is clearly complicated and takes time, I imagine, to progress from beginning to end. ""Yes,"" Sevdali explains, ""It's not a short process - we want it to be right, not fast - but really, everything starts with the Sonos product. The Flexson product team - who are all keen Sonos users, by the way - brainstorm possible accessory ideas, including input from our customers. Nothing is disregarded at this stage - all ideas welcome! ""We then research and evaluate the ideas, considering user requirements in detail, before making our final selection to go into production. A product brief is then created, with design concepts, manufacturing processes, timescales and costs. We go through a thorough prototyping process, optimising and refining designs until they're ready for sign-off. Once they're in production, we concentrate on creating clear packaging and imagery, so customers can easily see and understand what they're buying."" Well, that really doesn't sound like a short process! How long does it take from first idea to the product on sale? Sevdali says, ""Depending on the type and complexity of product, between four to eight months. The more complex products often require tooling for moulded components which increases our time to market project schedule. Sevdali has already mentioned the importance of matching the Sonos design. It's a fine line between between being invisible and too noticeable, perhaps. ""With our wall mounts we aim be discreet but functional with the minimum of fuss to install and set up. Our floor stands, on the other hand, are on display so we take the lead from the Sonos product to enable us to complement their design. I know how I react when I first see a new Sonos product, like the Beam, for instance, but Sevdali has a different take: ""We have to be in the mind-set of the end user, how they (that includes us as Sonos users) will use the speaker and how they will interact with it. The Beam is a great example, using simple forms cleverly executed, upgrading TV sound, playing music and with Alexa voice control. We considered all the ways it could be used, more than just with a TV. For example, our Adjustable Wall Mount is ideal for mounting the Beam under a Kitchen cabinet."" Sevdali mentions the Beam, which is clearly a different design language from Sonos designs of years ago. Does this mean Flexson has to evolve its design approach, too? ""Yes, absolutely,""Sevdali says, ""Some of our designs are functional products hidden by the Sonos speaker, which you could say need to workbehind the scenes. When our product will also be on display we want it to integrate with Sonos, being considerate to the Sonos design."" Flexson products are very diverse, so I wonder if some are more challenging, or more fun, when it comes to designing them. Sevdali smiles, ""Actually, the most challenging projects tend to also be the most fun, requiring creative and innovative solutions. Designs involving the use of different manufacturing processes are always fun and give us more flexibility and scope when designing. For example, our Wall mounts for Play:1 and Sonos One are an extremely efficient little design, super-compact with all the functionality needed, and they look great, too. This could only be achieved by investing in high-quality bespoke moulded components to give our customers what they need, and of course we love seeing people using our products. Seeing them both sold and used by Sonos itself is particularly gratifying."" Sevdali recognises there are challenges when it comes to prioritising the look or the practical requirements for a Flexson accessory. ""We always aspire to encompass both, to optimise the aesthetic but of course as an accessory manufacturer we must always meet the functional requirements."" There's more to Flexson than speaker stands, such as the connectivity items like cables which have a very different design to them. Because they'll largely be hidden does that modify how you think of them? This reflects back to the original specification we set ourselves, our products must be functional, complement the Sonos product and be efficient in doing so. The connectivity products do not sit alongside Sonos products and are intended to be hidden away, hence we've kept the forms simple and efficient to manufacture allowing us to pass on value engineered products to our customers.",0.003,0.827,0.17,0.9995

                                         two hardware companies that have seen their stocks plummet since their hot initial public offerings.  Donât miss: Why Sonos thinks its hardware IPO will be different  Sonos shares were down 4.7% in midday trading, though theyâd been indicating higher premarket. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who began coverage with a hold rating and a $23 price target, is concerned about the companyâs growth profile. He sees âno high-growth revenue catalyst on the horizon,â though he noted that the company plans to start releasing two new products a year for the first time in an attempt to jolt growth. Thill also discussed the competitive environment for smart speakers, writing that companies like Google and Amazon can afford to subsidize smart speakers to help their voice assistants gain acceptance. Sonos, on the other hand, focuses on higher-end products.  âWhile the experience is premium, the higher price point of Sonosâ products makes it a difficult hurdle for consumers in the low-mid tier range (compared to low priced speakers like Amazonâs Echo for $99 or Echo dot for $50),â Thill commented.   See also: 5 things to know about the maker of high-end speakers  Stifel analyst Matthew Sheerin views Sonosâ high-end positioning as a positive, though he still worries about âcompetition coming from all sides.â Amazon and Google now have more expensive models that are more in line with what Sonos offers, and other audio-focused companies are getting more serious about smart speakers.  âDespite that competition, we still see Sonos with a competitive edge due to its âstickyâ relationship with its large and loyal installed base, which should drive refreshes and add-on products; and Sonosâ âplatform agnosticâ position with regard to third-party streaming services,â Sheerin wrote. He also said that the companyâs path to profitability could be difficult and deems the stock fairly priced around current levels.  Sheerin has a hold rating and $20 price target on the stock, which recently changed hands at $19.22.  Morgan Stanleyâs Katy Huberty, who began coverage with an equal-weight rating and $20 price target, said that the companyâs new product launches will determine whether it avoids the fate of Fitbit and GoPro.  âIf new products fail to meet expectations, we think the multiple will contract similar to Fitbit and GoPro after their initial product missteps,â Huberty wrote. (That equates to about one times revenue, or $7, per Morgan Stanleyâs âbear caseâ valuation scenario.) She argued that the stock could trade more in line with shares of Logitech International SA

                                        Â if its new products outperform expectations. That could mean a multiple of about three times revenue, which gives Huberty a $34 âbull caseâ valuation. Huberty said she remains sidelined until she sees whether new items like the Beam, a sound bar, can exceed expectations. Other analysts were more positive. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a $25 price target, writing of his expectation for double-digit growth over the long run. The company is at the âunique intersectionâ of streaming music, Wi-Fi penetration, and voice assistants, all of which are technologies that should see increased usage over the next few years.  Daryanani doubts that the company will become the next Fitbit or GoPro because user engagement trends look strong; nearly half of registered households use the Sonos app daily. âFitbit and GoPro had a strong initial surge of popularity but that user engagement for the devices likely declined after purchase.â  See also: How we are using voice assistants, in one chart  Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall is also bullish on the stock, beginning coverage at buy with a $25 price target.  âWe believe Sonosâ increased product cadence will improve customer engagement in reaching beyond the companyâs loyal customer base and we expect frequent product launches to help drive more consistent revenue growth,â Hall wrote. âSonos also possesses what we see as valuable multiroom music streaming intellectual property that should be monetizeable over time.â  The companyâs IP portfolio could enable it to bring multiple voice assistants into a single product, what Hall would deem to be a âunique ability.â Raymond James analyst Adam Tindle, meanwhile, is upbeat about the companyâs potential to expand into the portable-speaker market. âWe see portable speakers as a natural extension into a total addressable market that should be north of $5 billion, and a product that would be additive to systems,â he wrote. âBeyond this areas such as headphones, and perhaps eventually automobiles, provide further growth vectors over time.â  Tindle has an outperform rating and $24 price target on the shares, which are up about 28% from their IPO price of $15.

 The Amazon Echo Dot is a great way to bring the voice-controllable assistant Alexa into your home. But because of its small size, the smart speaker isn’t exactly known for delivering a high-quality sound experience. Thankfully, there are a number of speakers that you can pair with the Echo Dot to upgrade your listening experience. In this article, we recommend the best Echo Dot speakers available to buy today.  


Sonos PLAY:1 Compact Wireless Smart Speaker for Streaming Music (Black)


Sonos PLAY:1 Compact Wireless Smart Speaker for Streaming Music (Black)

While you can control music with a voice command to the Echo Dot, you’ll also have to specify the room as well. Another downside is that only music control is available on the Play:1. Any other Alexa commands will only playback through the Echo Dot. Buyers can select from a black or white version of the speaker. If you’d like a more full-featured experience, the Sonos One (read our Sonos One review) features built-in Alexa support without the limitations of the Play:1 and Echo Dot.

The Analysts Morgan Stanley ...",2018-08-27 14:08:53,,Analysts Tune In To Sonos As IPO Quiet Period Expires,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-tune-sonos-ipo-quiet-140853305.html,,"Analysts covering newly public Sonos, Inc. (NASDAQ: SONO) consider the companyâs customer engagement, market opportunities and product launches as key catalysts for success. The Analysts The Thesis Morgan Stanley's initiation comes pending evidence of new products outperforming forecasts, Huberty said.  Sonos owns important intellectual property in enabling wireless connectivity for speakers and streaming services, the analyst said.  âTo maintain differentiation in a crowded $18-billion home audio market, Sonos must leverage its technology stack to expand into new use cases for new and existing households (we collectively call new 'rooms') and deepen its integration with streaming, voice and home automation platforms ('smart' capabilities),â Huberty said. Stifel's Sheerin said Sonos has a solid market position and brand awareness, despite the heavy competitive landscape. Recent data demonstrates that 84 percent of audio professionals recommend Sonos, while 57 percent recommend the brand specifically for Wi-Fi speakers, the analyst said.  ""Despite that competition, we still see Sonos with a competitive edge due to its 'sticky' relationship with its large and loyal installed base, which should drive refreshes and add-on products; and Sonosâ 'platform agnostic' position with regard to third-party streaming services (it supports 100) as well as the three major voice-recognition platforms (Amazon-Alexa, Apple-Siri and OK-Google, which should be available by year's end),"" Sheerin said.  Jefferies' Thill refers to Sonos as ""The Lego of speakers with consistent but low growth,"" noting that while revenue has increased 9 percent, analysts remain skeptical of breakout revenue growth. Sonos has an agnostic platform, the opportunity to expand into new verticals and a strong portfolio of patents and technology as catalysts going forward, he said.  Conversely, the lack of high growth revenue, increasingly competitive landscape and an evolving untested business model are headwinds that drive Thill's hesitance, according to the note.  According to Tindle, Sonos demonstrates strong brand leadership, an emphatic customer base and tighter cost controls. ""We see SONO as a stock in which solid revenue growth, stable gross margin, and an improved operating structure should lead to meaningful EBITDA growth, and these tend to be winners,"" he said.  Raymond James' Tindle referenced the company's new management as a strong catalyst. ""While [the] adjusted EBITDA margin has hovered in the 5-percent range, we believe the combination of a 40-percent-plus gross margin and a more efficient operating structure should lead to an adjusted EBITDA margin more than double the current profile. We analyze a recent industry turnaround story to show how a template exists.""

 @ChanceHMiller Apple officially released its HomePod smart speaker back in February, which means it has now spent over six months on the market and six months in the hands of consumers like myself. The HomePod has been one of the most polarizing Apple product releases in recent memory, with many praising its sound quality and integration with the Apple ecosystem, but many also knocking it for its high price and feature parity to devices like the Amazon Echo. I was an undeniable HomePod skeptic at first, but over the last six months, it has become a reliable and integral part of my smart home setup. 

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Sylvania HomeKit Light Strip Usually when I buy a new Apple product, thereâs an early period of time thatâs like the honeymoon phase of a new relationship; the lust and aura of the newness outshines any flaws. With the HomePod, however, my experience was perhaps the exact opposite. I distinctly remember the unboxing and setup process on day one with the HomePod. After setting it up, I was impressed immediately by its sound quality, but it was nearly impossible to ignore the gaping lack of AirPlay 2. Sure, one HomePod sounded great, but the 2-second lag with AirPlay and lack of stereo/multi-room support was impossible to overlook. It was during this period where I questioned the HomePod and the worthiness of its price tag. I had two Sonos One speakers, set up in stereo mode, around my iMac âÂ and that was a great experience in terms of sound. With Sonosâ promise of AirPlay 2 support âÂ and its more diverse lineup of speakers âÂ it was hard to deny its advantages over Apple.  Of course, there were areas where the HomePod excelled in comparison to Sonos. Its integration with the rest of Appleâs ecosystem, HomeKit control, and design being a few of them. Still, I debated whether or not those positives outweighed the many negativesâ¦ Sure enough, AirPlay 2 would eventually come and Iâd do almost a full 180 degree change in opinion. Almost three months after the HomePodâs initial release, Apple pushed iOS 11.4 with AirPlay 2 support. At the time of AirPlay 2âs release, I had a single HomePod âÂ meaning I couldnât take advantage of features like multi-room and stereo. Sure enough, my colleague Zac Hall had several HomePods and was ready to test AirPlay on day one, and quickly convinced me to join the club. So, I decided to sell my stereo Sonos One setup and add an additional HomePod âÂ thus having a stereo HomePod setup around my iMac. You donât necessarily think that stereo is going to make a huge difference in real-world use âÂ but it really does. Going from a single HomePod (or even two HomePods setup in pseudo-stereo mode) to a true stereo HomePod experience is remarkable. And thatâs as it should be. At $350 a pop âÂ $700 for a full stereo experience âÂ the HomePod is expensive and up there in price with some of the most high-end audio brands. And I think it does just enough to warrant that price tag, at least from a sound quality perspective. In time, Sonos has added AirPlay 2 support to its speakers, as well âÂ and thatâs a huge upgrade compared to having to use the Sonos app on iOS and macOS.  Perhaps more than any other Apple product, the HomePod is far, far from perfect. While things have gotten dramatically better over the last several months, there are still so many ways Apple can âÂ and needs toÂ âÂ improve its smart speaker. While the HomePodâs integration with the Apple ecosystem is generally excellent, its friendliness with macOS âÂ outside of iTunes âÂ is weak. You canât choose a HomePod stereo pair as a system audio output, with macOS instead seeing both speakers in a stereo pair as individuals â gravely limiting stereo support outside of iTunes. I mentioned earlier that Sonos offers a more diverse lineup of smart speakers than Apple does, but the question is whether or not Apple cares. While some sketchy reports have suggested that Apple has a âcheaperâ HomePod planned, thereâs no solid evidence to suggest such a thing. I also wonder if a âcheaperâ HomePod is necessarily the answer. Iâd be more interested in seeing different form factors âÂ such as a soundbar or a larger Play:5-like design. While some form factors would inherently be cheaper than the current HomePod, Iâd rather see Apple focus on excellent sound quality in different form factors (soundbar?) rather than getting the price as low as possible. Another possibility that might ease the blow in terms of price is to offer discounted pricing for stereo HomePod pairs. As I mentioned earlier, you currently have to shell out some $700 to buy two HomePods. Apple could make this slightly more bearable by discounting the two-pack price to something like $600 or even $650. Weâve seen companies like Sonos do this, and it only makes sense for Apple to do the same.  One more thing to consider is how the first few months of HomePod availability affected the public perception of the device. In lacking features like multi-room, stereo, and other AirPlay 2 improvements, thereâs an argument to be made that Apple may have significantly hindered HomePod sales as competitors like Sonos offered many of those features. It comes back to the overarching theme of taking time to launch a âperfectâ product, or launching a half-baked product and improving it over time with software updates. I wonât get into that here, but I think Apple would have been far better off waiting until AirPlay 2 was ready to release HomePod in the first place. In its current form, the HomePod is a great speaker and a great tool for controlling a smart home. Notice I didnât say it was a great âsmart speaker.â As it stands right now, you can get more intelligent âÂ and more affordable âÂ  smart speakers from companies like Amazon. The HomePod, of course, integrates with the Apple ecosystem in an unprecedented way, and offers superior sound quality to nearly any smart speaker out there, but it lacks in intelligence when compared to the Alexa devices. As time progresses, Apple will undoubtedly continue to expand the HomePodâs feature set. Weâve already heard that iOS 12 will bring new features such as multiple timers, phone call support, and more. Beyond new software features, the future of the HomePod is unclear. Is there room in the market for differing form factors? Absolutely. But does Apple care about catering to those differing needs? Only time will tell. What do you think about HomePod six months after its initial release? Has it found a place in your home or have you turned to other smart speaker offerings? Let us know down in the comments!

          146 View  comments All mod cons: Cartoon character Jane Jetson with her gadgets in the 1960s The gadgets we think of as home essentials have changed beyond recognition in the past few decades. In 1970, just 35 per cent of homes had a landline telephone and there were no mobiles. Now, technologies that were once the stuff of science fiction are part of our daily lives: take Amazonâs Alexa â inspired by the talking computer on the Starship Enterprise in Star Trek.Â  Today, millions of British households own these âsmart speakersâ that allow voice commands to control everything from TVs to lighting systems. Indeed, as of this year, one in five households will be âsmartâ, with devices that are wirelessly connected to the internet, and controlled via smartphone or a hub. By 2022, it will be closer to half of families relying in some way on them. Meanwhile, devices once pronounced dead â such as vinyl record players â are catching a second wind in a new century, as families opt for higher sound quality (and pleasing looks) over the convenience of digital music. Todayâs best innovations offer a mix of retro appeal, connected convenience and bargain prices. But what really makes a gadget a must-have? Sir James Dyson (above) made more than 5,000 prototypes of his vacuum cleaner but his idea was rejected by all major manufacturers. It took 13 years before the Dual Cyclone became Britainâs fastest-selling vacuum cleaner of all time âGood design and engineering is about solving a real problem in an ingenious way â approaching it from a new angle through the application of science, design, and engineering,â says Sir James Dyson, who knows a thing or two about the subject: his dual-cyclone vacuum cleaners turned him into one of Britainâs best-known inventors, now worth an estimated Â£7.8 billion. He adds: âIt is not easy, and the result should cause people to increase their expectations of technology.â Dyson himself made more than 5,000 prototypes of his vacuum cleaner but his idea was rejected by all major manufacturers. It took 13 years before the Dual Cyclone became Britainâs fastest-selling vacuum cleaner of all time. Despite this, he agrees that not all inventions are actually advances. âThe term âgadgetâ is associated with novelty and conjures images of those gifts that are consigned to the back of a cupboard once Christmas is over,â he says. âWe should be very demanding when we choose the technologies and products to equip our homes â they should be useful and long lasting in their utility.â With this in mind, we bring you our must-read guide to the 50 most innovative and best-value home gadgets on the market right now. Weâve chosen a mix of performance and price, with something to fit every room in your house. Invest in one or two and you may be left wondering how you ever managed without themâ¦ Hallway heroes 1. THE UNBEATABLE VACUUM Dyson Big Ball Animal 2. Â£299.99, dyson.co.uk. Like a Weeble, this powerful vacuum wobbles but wonât fall down, thanks to a âself-rightingâ system built into the ball-shaped base. Designed to cope with lots of pet hair, itâs easy to manoeuvre, you empty it without touching the grime inside and there are no fiddly filters to change 2. NO MORE âKEY UNDER PLANT POTâ Masterlock Select Access Smart, Â£124.80, safe.co.uk. For anyone whoâs ever left a key out for guests underneath an âinconspicuousâ plant pot near their front door, this is a much safer solution. The lock box is a perfect place to hide keys, and you can change the access code every time via the Bluetooth app â great for Airbnb hosts or people with a lot of guests 3. KNOCK KNOCK, WHOâS THERE... Nest Hello, Â£229 nest.com. This video smart doorbell finally gives you the upper hand in the war with delivery men and the postman. Every time someone goes near your front door, it alerts you, and if someone rings the doorbell, youâre instantly alerted via the app, and can talk through a speaker in the doorbell, so you can say âJust leave it in the recycle binâ rather than getting one of those infuriating âYou were outâ cards 4. SMARTER SECURITY Cocoon, Â£159, cocoon.life. Why settle for a security camera that watches one corner of one room, when this system listens for sounds throughout your whole home. You get an alert every time it detects something unusual (so it wonât trouble you if itâs just the cat), and thereâs a wide-angle camera which records continuously 5. LIGHT UP THE ROOM Philips Hue Motion Sensor, Â£35, argos.co.uk. Become the sort of person who lights up a room simply by walking into it with this clever motion sensor that pairs with the Philips Hue smart lighting system. It requires no installation (just a Hue Bridge plugged into your router). It also detects when rooms are vacant and turns off the lights 6. HEAT CONTROL ON THE HOP Netatmo Thermostat, Â£104.99, officeoutlet.com.

55,Kim Wetzel,"There’s a lot to like about the LG WK7 smart speaker with ThinQ technology. It offers solid sounding bass and vocals, and gets the job done as a Google Assistant smart speaker. We tested the speaker out to learn more about LG’s latest effort, which also happe…",2018-08-25 20:00:44,,LG ThinQ WK7 review,https://www.digitaltrends.com/speaker-subwoofer-reviews/lg-thinq-wk7-review/,https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/lg-thinq-wk7-review-7-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg,"The smart speaker market is bursting at the seams, as many manufacturers are clamoring to add either Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, or even Cortana voice assistantÂ functionality to their devices. The way the market is going now, it wouldnât surprise us to see almost all powered speakers include smart voice technology within a few years. LG has thrown its hat into the smart speaker ring with the ThinQ WK7, which uses Google Assistant. Made for sound at $200, the speaker is an affordable alternative to Googleâs bass buster, the Google Home Max, which comes in at $399. We gave the WK7 a test drive to see whether it stands out in the crowd. The WK7 is a sturdy, utilitarian speaker, and the components seem well made and durable. But something about the design feels uninspired. One person in our office called it âtubby.â The device is charcoal black in color. It stands 8.3 inches tall and is pillar-like with a 5.3-inch diameter. Itâs a bit hefty at 4.2 pounds. On the top of the device are volume +/- buttons, a play/pause button, and an âFâ button, which stands for function. Thatâs the button you tap to connect to Bluetooth devices. On the back of the speaker, thereâs a mic on/off button, and on the bottom thereâs an A/C Adapter plug and a reset button. Overall, the WK7 isnât going to win any beauty contests, but its heft makes it feel like a quality speaker One thing we like about most Google Assistant speakers is how easy it is to set them up thanks to the Google Home app. Nowadays, the device and app do the bulk of the work for you. Getting the WK7 up and running was no different. The speaker offers a whole lot of powerful sound and should satisfy those on a budget. First, downloading the Google Home app is required. After youâre squared away there, plug in the WK7 and wait for it to boot up. Youâll hear the trademark piano notes as the device indicates itâs ready to go. Open up the app, hit the options tab on the top left of the screen, and tap âDevices.â If all is working properly, the WK7 will show up automatically, and youâll be asked if you want to set it up. Those new to Google Home will have a bit more work to do here, like adding preferred streaming music choices (choices include Spotify, Pandora and Deezer, with Google Play and YouTube Music set as defaults) and creating your voice match profile. If you have existing smart home devices, you can add them by tapping on the Home Control option and following instructions from there. At this point, there are more than 5,000 smart home devices that work with Google Assistant. For those who already have an existing Google Home device and app, the setup process is even more painless, with the WK7 taking just a couple minutes to get up and running. Once youâre connected to the speaker, all the existing smart home devices you have connected to the app will automatically be linked to the speaker. The WK7 can do all the things that a Google Home device is able to do with voice commands, whether it be turning on smart home lights, locking the front door, or asking Google Assistant who invented the cotton gin (answer: Eli Whitney). We connected our Noon lighting with the WK7, and were easily able to control our kitchen, dining room, and living room lights by simply asking the speaker to turn them on or off. When we asked about the weather, we got the typical Google Assistant detailed answer. The WK7âs performance can best be summed up by a line from our favorite John Prine song: âPretty good, not bad, I canât complain.”. Overall, the WK7 works well as a functional smart speaker that does all the things a Google Home device can do. We do have a small gripe though: During testing, we sometimes noticed a significant lag between our âHey Googleâ request and when the speaker complied. For example, while playing music on Pandora, we said, âHey Google, volume 4.â Several times, a full nine or 10 seconds would pass before the volume adjustment was made. Other times it would take about four seconds for the speaker to comply. Curious, we conducted the same test on our Amazon Echo Show device. There, the lag time between request and compliance was about two seconds. Thinking it might be a third-party device issue, we conducted a similar test on our Sonos One Alexa-enabled speaker. There we found a four-second lag time. Like a lot of new smart speakers we see hitting the market, the WK7âs performance can perhaps best be summed up by a line from our favorite John Prine song: âPretty good, not bad, I canât complain.â The speaker offers a whole lot of powerful sound, all for a very nice price, and should satisfy those looking to bump their kitchen or living room on a budget â and oh how it likes to thump. In terms of size and power, the WK7 sits somewhere between the Appleâs HomePod and Googleâs Home Max, and while it canât offer the fidelity of those speakers, it also costs about half the price. The WK7 also doesnât provide the kind of detail or instrumental definition offered by Sonosâ killer new smart speaker, the Sonos One. Then again, few smart speakers (if any) do at the $200 price point. What the WK7 does offer is solid performance with an emphasis on booming bass and prominent vocals to out match similarly affordable smart speakers like those in Amazonâs Echo family. This allows the WK7 to do justice to everything from your favorite acoustic tracks to hip-hop jams — especially if youâre just using it as background sound while you cook dinner or chat with company. In fact, itâs pretty impressive how much full sound LG (along with its new audio partner, Meridian) was able to extract from the stout pillar without distorting. The WK7 packs an impressive amount of sound into its hearty frame for the money. To do so, however, the company has loaded up a lot of digital signal processing (DSP) for a pretty colored sound signature, along with plenty of compression/limiting. The former saps some of the natural sonic flavors from your music — think flattened horns and dulled stringed instruments — while the latter presents some interesting issues when the speaker is faced with the most challenging bass-heavy songs. When auditioning Too Shortâs Just Another Day (one of our go-to bass tracks), we noted a surprising level of midrange and treble being sucked out of the sound as the speaker struggled to reproduce the songâs lowest bass hit, which bottoms out somewhere around 40-50Hz. In other words, the speaker was simply trying too hard, and the resulting overcompensation made for a very uneven listen. Overall, though, while we wished for more detail and definition, the WK7 packs an impressive amount of sound into its hearty frame for the money and should satisfy most budget-conscious listeners looking for more boom than what youâll get from Sonos or Amazon. The WX7 comes with a one-year parts and labor warranty. Overall, the WK7 is a solid-sounding speaker at an affordable price point. It provides prominent bass and vocals for those who want to showcase thumping sound. The fact that Google Assistant is built into the device allows it to serve double duty as a smart home hub. It depends on what youâre looking for. If youâre not married to Google Assistant, definitely consider the Sonos One Alexa-enabled speaker, which is similarly priced at $199 and features stellar sound. If you want a great sounding smart speaker with Google Assistant built in and money is no object, thereâs the Google Home Max ($399). Note that LG plans to release a smart speaker with an 8-inch screen any day now. Other than the price tag ($299), we donât know much about whether the new device will be marketed as a speaker for sound or smarts, though. Th WK7 feels sturdy, well-made, and comes from one of the most reliable electronics companies out there. We think this speaker will last several years if properly cared for. We canât promise that LG wonât come out with a new and improved smart speaker in a year or two though. If youâre looking for an affordable, respectable-sounding smart speaker with Google Assistant, then buy the WK7. Youâll be happy with its performance.",0.023,0.809,0.168,0.9997
56,Lory Gil,"Thanks to an update from Sonos, four speakers in the lineup support AirPlay 2, which means you can play music from your iPhone or iPad without needing a Wi-Fi connection and you can ask Siri to play something through your Sonos speaker. Products Used In This …",2018-08-25 13:00:01,,How Does Sonos One Work with AirPlay 2?,https://www.imore.com/how-does-sonos-one-work-airplay,https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2017/10/sonos-one-review-2.jpg?itok=9thVX-gp," Thanks to an update from Sonos, four speakers in the lineup support AirPlay 2, which means you can play music from your iPhone or iPad without needing a Wi-Fi connection and you can ask Siri to play something through your Sonos speaker. There are two bits of software that you'll need to update in order to update the firmware for your Sonos One. First, you'll need to make sure that your iPhone is updated to version 11.4 or higher. You must be running iOS 11.4 or higher to get AirPlay 2. The next thing you'll need to update is the Sonos Controller app to version 9.0 or higher. Version 9.0 brings with it support for AirPlay 2. Once both your iPhone and the Sonos controller app have been updated, open the Sonos controller app. You should be automatically directed to update your speaker, but if it doesn't happen automatically, navigate to the Settings section under the More tab and tap Online Updates. The Sonos Controller app will send the firmware update to your Sonos One speaker.  After you've updated your Sonos One firmware, you'll be able to add the speaker to your Home app, where you'll be able to stream music from Control Center or ask Siri to play something. Launch the Home app on your iPhone and then tap the add button in the upper right corner of your Home page. When prompted, tap Add Accessory and follow the instructions to add your Sonos One speaker.  Once you're all set up, you can start playing music either directly on your iPhone or by asking Siri. If you want to play music from your iPhone, select a song from your favorite music player, then navigate to Control Center and tap on the Now Playing widget. From here, you can select your Sonos One. You can also ask Siri to play tunes for you. Just say, ""Hey Siri, play my playlist on Sonos One."" Note: Siri will only play music from Apple Music.  AirPlay 2 is only supported on Sonos One, Sonos Beam, Sonos Playbase, and the second-generation Play:5. But, that doesn't mean you can't use AirPlay 2 with your older or non-Airplay supported Sonos speaker system. As long as you have one of the AirPlay 2 supported speakers, you can connect the rest of your Sonos system and pipe your favorite tunes throughout the entire house. The Sonos One is the least expensive of the four supported speakers, so if you don't already have one, you can pick one up on Amazon and add it to your Sonos system. These are the mandatory or core equipment selections. Optional or ancillary equipment will follow. If you've already invested in the Sonos speaker ecosystem or you're just getting started and want test the waters first, Sonos One is the least expensive of the supported speakers. While it's the company's first foray into smart speakers, it's still a solid choice, especially if you also want Alexa-support and all that goes with that. Plays nice with Siri and your HomePod Sonos One is the least expensive of the AirPlay 2 supported Sonos speakers so you'll get the biggest bang for your buck. You need an iOS device in order to use AirPlay and that devices needs to be able to run iOS 11.4 or higher to support AirPlay 2. The iPhone X is Apple's latest and greatest and I'm not sure it can get any better than this. The most advanced iPhone on the market If you're part of the Apple ecosystem already, the iPhone X is currently the best one you can buy. Why not upgrade?

Bookmark Kinja Deals and follow us on Twitter and Facebook, or sign up for our newsletter to never miss a deal.  If you havenât hopped aboard the sound bar train, and still like to build your home theater audio setup piecemeal, this 7.2 channel Onkyo receiver is down to $350 on Amazon in todayâs Gold Box, an all-time low by $50, and $150 less than usual. Advertisement  That gets you six HDR/4K-capable HDMI ports, built-in Chromecast, and even the ability to configure your speaker outputs for 5.2.2 Dolby Atmos or DTS:X 3D audio, rather than traditional 7.2 surround sound. Just note that todayâs price is only available today, and could sell out early. Amazonâs back-to-school deals on Echo devices are live, and you donât have to be a student to take advantage. The Echo Dot and Echo deals are just okay, but the Echo Plus and Echo Show discounts are excellent. You donât need to buy a new car to experience Apple CarPlay or Android Auto; you just need $231 for this receiver, plus whatever it costs to install it (if you canât do it yourself). Thatâs the best price weâve ever seen for a CarPlay/Android Auto receiver, and itâs particularly great considering this one includes a large 6.75"" capacitive touchscreen - cheaper receivers are usually resistive. Update: If you missed this deal on Tuesday, theyâre back in stock again! If the black one shows as sold out, try the white model. Advertisement  While it doesnât support Alexa or AirPlay 2 like the newer Sonos One, the original Sonos Play:1 is still a terrific sounding speaker that can sync up with other Sonos products for multi-room audio. Normally $149, Sonos just put a batch of certified refurbs on sale for $119, matching the best price weâve ever seen. Every refurbished Sonos includes the standard one-year Sonos warranty and access to their support, so thereâs really no downside in going this route, if you can find refurbs in stock. Every other time Sonos has offered this deal, itâs sold out quickly. Appleâs 12"" MacBook is one of the thinnest and most travel-friendly laptops out there, and you can get the original 2015 model for $700-$750 from Woot today, depending on the amount of storage you need. Advertisement  Again, this computer is a few years old at this point, and it wasnât exactly a powerhouse when it was originally released. But if you just need a travel-friendly Mac, and donât need it to be particularly powerful, this is one of the best deals weâve seen. I have the 2016 model as my work computer, and it fits perfectly on an economy airline tray table. Wi-Fi range extenders canât work miracles, but if thereâs one spot in your house with spotty coverage, they can be a much cheaper solution than buying a new router. So at $21, why not give this one a try? Just clip the $5 coupon to get the deal at checkout. If youâre ready to make the leap to 4K (and if your computer can handle it), Amazonâs blowing out 28"" Samsung monitors for just $250, right now. Itâs not an IPS panel, unfortunately, but thatâs still one of the best prices weâve ever seen on a 60Hz 4K display. We saw this available for $220 a few weeks ago, but that was a refurb, and this oneâs brand new. You probably keep a lot of charging cables, battery packs, hard drives, and other sundry tech accessories rattling around in your bag, and your collection is unlikely to shrink any time soon. But itâs easy to keep them organized and untangled with this $10 organizer (with promo code KDQD4Z6K), which is big enough to hold an iPad mini-sized tablet, plus a ton of various accessories. Logitech MX Master 2S Mouse | $70 | Amazon The incredible Logitech MX Master mouse was the sequel to one of our readersâ favorite mice, and the new MX Master 2S is the sequel to the sequel. Advertisement  You still get an ergonomic design, great battery life, and a mouse sensor that works on any surface, including glass. But the 2S increases resolution from 1,000 DPI to 4,000, and introduces Logitechâs flow software, which lets you switch between computers on the fly, and even drag or copy files or your clipboard from machine to machine. Amazonâs marked the 2S down to $70 today, a price topped only by a one-day deal in June that brought it down to $60. Your laptop is one of the most expensive things you own, and it deserves to be treated as such. Rather than throwing it roughshod into your bag, slip it into one of PicasoLabsâ beautiful, hand-stitched leather sleeves, now back on sale just for our readers, this weekend only. Advertisement  Jesus Diaz raved about these and interviewed the creator on Gizmodo a few years ago, and now you can pick your own from Amazon for 15% off with promo code KINJA015, plus $8 if you want it engraved. There are several options available, and prices will vary depending on the size of your laptop. Theyâre all designed specifically for various MacBook models, but compare measurements, and you could probably find one to fit your Windows Ultrabook as well. No matter which one you choose, youâll save 15% at checkout with that promo code. You donât need to spend hundreds of dollars to enjoy the benefits of noise canceling headphones: These TaoTronics noise canceling over-ears are down to just $40 today with promo code KINJAH48. Advertisement  Iâve actually tried these, and while the ANC isnât as impressive as what youâd get from Sony or Bose, it definitely works, especially against consistent noises like fans or airplane engines. Theyâre also extremely comfortable, and fold up for easy storage. $40 is a steal, is what Iâm saying. Phone cameras will never have true interchangeable lenses, but you can still take wide angle and macro photos with a discounted Aukey lens attachment kit. Just clip it to the top of your phone, and take some pictures what otherwise wouldnât have been possible. The macro lens in particular is just a ton of fun to mess around with. If youâve dismissed Beats headphones in the past, itâs time to pay attention again. The Studio3 wireless sound much better than their predecessors, pair to Apple devices as easily as AirPods, and even include active noise cancelation. There may be better options at their regular $350 price tag, but theyâre a steal at $205, especially for iPhone owners. While 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound involves placing speakers around your room on a single plane, the concept behind Dolby Atmos audio is to give audio an element of height. If you donât want to install speakers in your ceiling though, this sound bar is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to pull off the effect. Advertisement  The LG S9KY Atmos Soundbar is a 5.1.2 system, but can be easily upgraded to 7.1.2 with a $175 rear channel expansion kit. Assuming you donât add extra speakers though, that means you get five regular audio channels in the sound bar, a wireless subwoofer for bass, and two special âobjectâ speakers that point upwards, and bounce sound off your ceiling, creating the effect of Atmos surround sound with minimal hardware. The S9KY costs around $700 around the web, but while supplies last, you can grab it from MassDrop for $420. Thatâs one of the best prices for any non-refurbished Atmos system weâve seen to date. Anker has a new, less expensive version of its excellent true wireless headphone line, and you can grab a set for just $60 today, or $20 less than usual. Advertisement  Like the original Liberty headphones, the Liberty Lites will run for 3.5 hours on a charge untethered - the main difference is that the included charging case only holds an extra 9 hours worth of battery, vs. 24 hours for the Liberty, and 48 for the Liberty+. Still though, thatâs enough for a dayâs worth of use in almost any situation, and the case is noticeably more pocket friendly, which was one of my least favorite aspects of the original models. Youâve probably heard a lot about mechanical keyboards in the past few years, and one of the best models on the market is on sale right now. Advertisement  Most mechanical keyboards are marketed towards gamers, but Das Keyboards are a typistâs dream. Their newest, the Das Keyboard 4, is only $119 right now, the best price weâve ever seen. You even get to choose between clicky Cherry MX Blue, and softer Brown switches. Thereâs nothing fancy about this TV. Itâs âonlyâ 1080p, it doesnât have HDR, and itâs not smart. But itâs 50"" and only $200, which are the two most important specs when youâre buying a secondary TV for a bedroom, patio, or any other space thatâs not your main home theater. Update: You can also add 5"" and 4K resolution for $50 more. At only 5W, this isnât Ankerâs fastest wireless charger around, but itâs reliable, comes with a great warranty, and will be perfectly suited to overnight Qi charging. Get it for $11 today with promo code KINJAAAA. Advertisement  Editorâs note: That promo code is also the noise I make whenever our sites go down. Anker makes a lot of really big battery packs. You probably own one or two of them. But itâs also worth keeping a pocket-friendly one in your arsenal for days when you need some extra juice, but donât want to carry a bag. This 5,000mAh model can fully recharge basically any smartphone at least once, and itâs only $16 right now with promo code ANKERPC9. For one day only, Amazonâs matching its Black Friday discount on the 4K/HDR/Dolby Atmos-packing Fire TV. Advertisement  While they last, you can snag the streaming boxÂ stick dongle for $40, a $30 discount, and a match for an all-time low. This is one of the best streaming devices you can buy at any price, so if itâs been on your wish list, donât miss this deal. Apple hasnât updated the iPad Mini 4 in a few years, but if you donât need the latest and greatest processor, and you prefer the smaller footprint, Walmartâs taking $100 off the 128GB model today, the best price weâve ever seen. Advertisement  Or, for $50 more, you can opt for the 9.7"" iPad fifth generation with the same amount of storage, and a processor thatâs one year newer. Itâs priced at $80 below its original MSRP, though unlike the iPad Mini, there is a newer model available. Boseâs wireless QuietComfort 35 noise-cancelling over-ears are basically a mute button for the rest of the world, and you can get them for $299 today, down from the usual $329. In addition to amazing sound quality and noise cancelation, they even work with Google Assistant, and as of a firmware update last week, Alexa too. Advertisement  If you prefer in-ear headphones, the Bose QuietControl 30 Bluetooth earbuds are also on sale for $249, or $50 less than usual. <Waves frantically in your eye-line to get your attention> Those are the best deals weâve ever seen on these! VPNs have been in the news, and whether you want to get around video geoblocks, circumvent proxy filters, or just keep prying eyes out of your browsing data while using sketchy public Wi-Fi, reader-favorite Private Internet Access has a deal to fit your needs. Advertisement  Private Internet Access doesnât do much in the way of discounting, but they offer exclusive pricing and packages just for our readers that you wonât find anywhere else. Here are your options, and what youâd pay if you bought the same plan elsewhere: These deals are only for our readers, but we arenât sure how long theyâll be available, so go ahead and sign up while you can. Buzio 48"" x 72"" 15 Pound Weighted Blanket | $56 | Amazon | Promo code UZ67IR34Buzio 60"" x 80"" 15 Pound Weighted Blanket | $67 | Amazon | Promo code J6OZY7XOBuzio 60"" x 80"" 20 Pound Weighted Blanket | $80 | Amazon | Promo code G3VTO4N3Buzio 60"" x 80"" 25 Pound Weighted Blanket | $127 | Amazon | Promo code BESEIN66 I know itâs summer and everything, but weighted blankets can work wonders for your anxiety in addition to keeping you warm, and several different models are on sale today for some of the best prices weâve seen, including a rare discount on a 25 pounder. Just note the promo codes. Advertisement  Personally, I want my weighted blankets to be capable of breaking ribs, but the general recommendation is 10% of your body weight. Not to stress you out, but we wouldnât expect this deal to last for long. Ankerâs Eufy RoboVac line has been a hit with our readers, to say the least, and now you can save on their new slim model. Advertisement  The RoboVac 11s actually features stronger suction than the original RoboVac 11 (1300Pa vs. 1000, and the old RoboVac 10 only had 400), and yet is nearly 1/4"" thinner. That doesnât seem like much, but it can be the difference between the vacuum scooting comfortably under the couch or getting itself stuck. The 11s usually sells for $230, but for a limited time, you can snag one for $180 with promo code EUFY1808. OxyLEDâs top-selling T-02 line of motion-sensing light strips now comes in a warm variety, and you can snag the plus-sized model for $20 today with promo code YZAWWFHL. The warm LEDs are flattering, making this great for a closet or wardrobe where youâll be looking in a mirror. OxyLED is best known for its battery-powered light strips, but this discounted kit plugs into an AC outlet, and is designed specifically for under-cabinet installation. Advertisement  The $22 kit (with promo code NVDCXXTJ) comes with three foot-long LED light bars, plus three connecting cables. You can either plug the bars into each other to create a longer strip, or use the cables to snake around corners and extend your setup. Once itâs all installed, just use the touch-sensitive power button to turn them on and adjust the brightness, and enjoy a well-lit countertop while you prepare dinner. If they donât keep your office cool enough in the summer, you can at least ease your own suffering a bit with a desk fan. These two models from SIMBR are small, adjustable, and most importantly, USB-powered. Just plug it into your computer, and enjoy the breeze. Itâs only $10 today, down from the usual $20. Nomatic 30L Travel Bag | $179 | Kickstarter Nomatic makes one of our readersâ favorite wallets, but its latest product is something else entirely: a 30L travel bag. Advertisement  Like the much-hyped Peak Design travel bag, which is also on Kickstarter at the moment, the Nomatic travel bag can be used as both a backpack and a duffel, and includes a massive opening for easy packing, a laptop sleeve, a sock and underwear compartment, and other cool organizational features. If you ask me though, the coolest feature is the shoe pocket, which can hold not one, but two pairs of menâs size 12 shoes, and can either be sealed shut to keep water out, or vented to help with smells. Nomaticâs already blown through its funding goal for this bag, and you can preorder one for $179 right now, compared to its $229 MSRP. The first time we posted a deal on wool dryer balls, you guys bought thousands of them. Todayâs deal is from a different brand, but $6 for a half-dozen (with code YZWDBSD6) is a fantastic deal. The REI Labor Day Sale, one of the retailerâs biggest sale of the year, is here. Get up to 40% off on an almost overwhelming amount of outdoor gear, from camping, to paddling, to hiking, to cycling, and everything in between. Itâll take some time to sort through everything, so youâd better get started now. Plus, grab an extra 20% off any one outlet item with the code OUTLET20. Not only is Backcountry giving you up to 50% off a ton of clothing, gear, and accessories from brands like Patagonia, The North Face, Marmot, and more, thereâs also an additional 20% off insulation gear from Columbia and Mountain Hardware, plus you can grab 30% off any full-price Arcâteryx item with the code ARCTERYX30. Phew, that was a lot to get out at once. It might not have the name recognition or cool factor of a YETI, but this 55 quart Lifetime cooler is a lot cheaper at just $97 today, and keeps ice frozen for up to seven days. It just met that threshold in this YouTube test, even when it was left outside in the hot sun. Sperry is ready to outfit your feet in any styles of shoe worth having with an extra 30% off sale styles with the code OUTLET30. That includes the boat shoes we all know and sometimes love, snow and rain boots, and even sweaters, dresses, coats, and sunglasses. ENO makes some of the most popular camping hammocks on the market, and Sierra Trading Post is offering significant (and rare) discounts on a few different models today. If you donât already own a set of tree straps, youâll want to grab some of those too. The Dyson Supersonic hair dryer took the hair tool market by storm, not just for its prowess at drying hair faster and easier, but because of itâs $400 price tag. But right now, Nordstrom Rack is selling refurbished white/silver and fuchsia/iron models for $250, a much more reasonable price point to dip your toe into luxury hair tools. Get it while supplies last. ASOS is a one-stop-shop for everything trendy and this sale is no exception. The sale says âsneaker brandsâ but that doesnât just mean sneakers. Sweatshirts, leggings, backpacks, and more are included along with a ton of sneakers from a bunch of athleisure brands, and everything is up to 30% off. No matter the season youâre shopping for, Eddie Bauer makes some great outdoor gear for everything from your head to your toes. So if you have any camping trips planned, or just want an excuse to take a hike, you can save 40% sitewide today with promo code SHARE during the Friends & Family Sale, plus free shipping over $49. There are a few exclusions, but nothing too bad: Offer excludes sleeping bags, Peak suits, tents, and non-Eddie Bauer brand products, previous purchases, gift card purchases, credit card payments, taxes, shipping, or other fees. John Krasinski is about to assume the role of Jack Ryan for a new Amazon series, his biggest action role since playing Golden Face in Threat Level Midnight. To celebrate the showâs impending release, Amazonâs discounting The Hunt For Red October to $2 on Kindle, or $6 as an audiobook, today only. For a limited time, Amazon is taking $3 off a selection of mystery and thriller books when you go to this page and click the button to add the credit to your account. Itâs not the widest selection, but most of the books are already priced in the $4-$5 range, so a $3 discount is pretty substantial if you need some new reading material. Walmart just partnered with Kobo to launch a new digital ebook storefront, and you can take advantage with a special $10 off deal on the your first purchase. This promo seems to apply automatically at checkout to to any ebook priced at $10.01 or more, so you could get a recent title for for just a couple of bucks, in most cases. Advertisement  You canât read the book on a Kindle device, but you can read any time in the Kobo app on your smartphone or tablet, or buy a Kobo e-reader. Sonyâs 500 Million Edition PS4 Pros sold out basically instantly, but you can still get the limited edition controller and headset piecemeal, for MSRP. Itâs tough to know if these will eventually sell out everywhere as well, but I think itâs a pretty safe assumption that there will never be a discount on them, so if you want them, grab them. Advertisement  This would also be a good time to mention that the standard Gold Headset (a reader favorite!) is still on sale for $80, if you can live without that translucent blue plastic. Update: The deals below are still available, and now, Splatoon 2, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Kirby Star Allies, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and Minecraft have joined them. Advertisement  If you have any notable holes in your Nintendo Switch game library, you can fill them today with rare discounts on first party Nintendo games. Breath of the Wild, SuperÂ Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Mario Tennis AcesÂ are all marked down to $45. Still need a Switch? The best deal running right now is the console plus the Labo kit of your choice for $339, a savings of up to $40. Whether youâve already played the sprawling, 20 pound GloomhavenÂ board game, or you still havenât found it in stock for a reasonable price, its more approachable prequel is on sale for $50 today, over $25 less than usual, and an all-time low.  Advertisement  Founders of Gloomhaven isnât quite the beast that Gloomhaven proper is, but itâs still a deep game. From Amazon: Football season is upon us, and you can bundle and save on a copy of Madden 19 and a yearâs subscription to NFL Game Pass with this exclusive deal from Walmart. Advertisement  If you buy Game Pass for $99 right now, youâll save $60 on a copy of Madden 19, which essentially makes the standard edition free, or the Hall of Fame edition only $20. Game Pass lets you stream out of market preseason games for free, and lets you watch full or condensed replays of every regular season game within 45 minutes of it ending. You can even search for footage by player or play type, and even get access to the All-22 footage, so you can eat tape for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ThinkGeekâs celebrating International Tabletop Day with a huge sale on board games and tabletop gaming accessories, for a limited time. Inside, youâll find levitating construction sets, a bunch of puzzles, and a whole slew of board games. If you have any particular recommendations, be sure to drop them in the comments. Unfortunately, itâs only available for new members, but if you want to get started with Xbox Live, Microsoft will sell you your first month for just $2, and throw in a second month for free. From 8/20/2018 â 8/31/2018, new members buying Xbox Live Gold 1 Month for $2 will get a second month automatically added to their account at no extra charge. Update: Amazonâs 6+3 month deal is still available, but if you just want to try out the service, Microsoft will sell you a single month for just $2, and toss in a second one for free. Advertisement  With Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft basically created the Netflix of video games, and itâs a great deal at its usual $10 per month. But for a limited time, you can get a three bonus months when you buy a six month membership for $60. Xbox Game Pass grants you access to new releases like State of Decay 2 and Sea of Thieves, as well as classics like KOTOR and all of the Gear of War games. Even Fallout 4 is included now! Just make sure you see the bonus months in the âspecial offers and product promotionsâ section of the product page. Amazon just announced that it will be discontinuing its 20% preorder discount on physical video games on August 28, and replacing it with a $10 Prime member credit on select games. A $12 cash discount is certainly preferable to a $10 store credit, though it sounds like some digital games may be included in the new benefit, so weâll withhold our verdict until we see how wide-ranging the credits are. Advertisement  In the meantime though, you still have until the 28th to lock in preorders with the 20% discount. Weâve listed out some of the most popular upcoming titles on this post, but the discount should work on basically any physical game, as long as youâre a Prime member. Just note that you wonât see the discount until checkout, and you wonât be charged until the game ships. Personally, I just put in an order for Fallout 76, which includes access to the beta. When these 3/4-sized Arcade1Up arcade cabinets first went on preorder for $299, we thought it was a mistake, since they were supposed to cost $399. At this point though, it seems clear that $299 is in fact what they now cost, but inventory is still limited, since they were out of stock for awhile. Advertisement  Anyway, theyâre all back now, and theyâre still $299, so if you want one, nowâs your chance.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and RBC are among banks that managed the speaker makerâs initial public offering who will be allowed to publish research after the quiet period ends. Other underwriters included Allen & Co., Jefferies, KKR & Co., Raymond James Financial and Stifel Nicolaus. Underwriting banks, tasked with promoting the issuing company and creating a market for its shares, employ perhaps some of the friendliest analysts on Wall Street. Still, a 39 percent gain since the Aug. 1 initial offering could make it difficult to justify further gains in coming months. More from Bloomberg.com: Will the Market Crash If Trump Is Impeached?

Besides having far better sound quality (especially bass) than regular bars, it makes a great TV stand and essentially disappears from view. It is great for TV sound and also excellent for music (not replacing a dedicated sound system, of course, but for listening while you make dinner or if you just want to sit and read instead of watch TV, itâs fantastic). In addition, it includes the usual Sonos qualities. I have mine set up with a couple of Play 1's for surround and the subwoofer for real rumble (a very impressive subwoofer, considering its size). - OsmodiousÂ  You donât even need a sub with the Playbase.

I needed something small that wouldnât hang over the edges of my TV stand (seriously, some of these soundbars are enormous), and Yamaha came very highly recommended.  Audiophiles may not like the built-in subwoofer as opposed to a standalone unit, but I donât want to shake the walls with the bass since those walls are shared. - Duke of Kent Advertisement  Advertisement  Five years after Sonos delivered the original Playbar, still one of the best soundbars you can getâ¦ You just can beat the sound that come out of this. That along with alexa integration and the ARC setup make this one great soundbar. Also, you donât need a new remote just to change the sound as most newer tvs send the command to the bar from the tv. - Keep It Stupid, Stupid Advertisement  Editorâs Note: This recommendation included the optional Sonos Sub, which can work with the Beam. Advertisement  Editorâs note: The recommendation was for the LG SJ9, but the SK9Y is the new model. Love this sound bar. Got mine at best buy too for 225 open box, crazy good deal for the performance. I have a Samsung soundbar with Atmos, the one without rear speakers, and itâs straight trash compared to this. It sounds fine and has an extra HDMI port but the performance. It has a 5 minute sleep function that means Iâm constantly fishing for the remote every time I step away from the television. Half the time it doesnât auto power with my tv, also Samsung btw, and periodically the wireless sub loses connection. Even worse the bar randomly decides that itâs inputs donât want to pass/accept 4.4.4 chroma content. Itâs a pain in the ass. The SJ9 only has one HDMI port, but it flawlessly passes 4.4.4 content including simultaneous Atmos and Dolby vision. It never loses connection, always powers on correctly, and the performance is fantastic. The bass isnât overpowering even with Atmos, a common problem with soundbars. And the surround effect has clear separation thatâs simply amazing from a single bar. The scene in blade runner 2049 where Joe encounters the bees ... youâd swear they were swarming all around you. Itâs so good itâs unsettling.

(WeWork Photo)
 WeWork is in the midst of a massive expansion that will more than double its presence in the Seattle area and make the co-working giant one of the biggest tenants in the region. The company rarely breaks out its presence in terms of square feet, but Jon Slavet, WeWorkâs managing director for the west, pulled back the curtain on the companyâs Seattle footprint in an interview with GeekWire. WeWork today has about 900,000 square feet of space spread across seven Seattle-area office buildings, and by early next year that figure will balloon to 1.5 million feet spread across 14 buildings, with even more activity further down the line. A footprint of 1.5 million square feet would be roughly the size of the Columbia Center, Seattleâs tallest and largest office building. The New York-based company is acknowledging some of these new locations for the first time, while others are advertised on the itsÂ website. Here is a snapshot of the WeWork offices set to open later this year into early 2019: WeWorkâs preferred metric to quantify its presence is the number of desks. In the Seattle area, that figure was 4,320 at the beginning of 2018, and the company expects to have 13,301 desks by early next year. This expansion, the company said, makes WeWork one of the top office users in the region, along with homegrown names like Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing and Starbucks and ahead of some of the most active out-of-town giants like Google and Facebook. âSeattle is a bright shining star for us,â Slavet said. To put it in perspective, 14 locations makes Seattle WeWorkâs biggest Northwest market by far, well ahead of Vancouver B.C. â five locations by the end of the year â and Portland with three. WeWorkâs Seattle presence is comparable to San Francisco and Los Angeles, with 17 and 16 locations respectively. All of that pales in comparison to the companyâs hometown of New York, where WeWork has 54 locations. Slavet said the region is one of the most dynamic markets in the world. Itâs a combination of some of the fastest-growing companies in the tech industry and an ever-expanding roster of out-of-town companies needing space immediately, making the area fertile ground for WeWorkâs model of providing flexible space quickly for companies of all sizes. Worldwide, WeWork aims to have 400 locations in 83 cities in 27 countries by the end of the year. WeWork has raised gobs of cash to fund this expansion, bringing in a whopping $1 billion round earlier this month. WeWork is at the forefront of a very active co-working industry that reflects the changing nature of how people and companies work. It wasnât long ago that Seattle hit a milestone of 1 million square feet of co-working space in the city, and now WeWork has surpassed that metric on its own. Though WeWork is the apple of the investment communityâs collective eye, it isnât the first, nor the only company in the co-working space. On a global level it battles companies like Regus, which has been around for close to 30 years and has more than 3,000 locations. The local market includes companies like The Riveter, Industrious, Atlas Workbase, Impact Hub and many more. Founded in 2010, WeWorkâs dizzying growth has come primarily within a years-long tech boom that has seen companies across the globe expand so fast the market demanded a quicker solution for setting up office space. By becoming one of the biggest office tenants in many cities and offering short-term leases, it could be stuck with the bill should the tech boom come crashing down. For most of its lifetime, WeWork has been associated with providing small, flexible office spaces for startups getting off the ground and companies not yet ready to commit to a permanent office. But WeWorkâs fastest growing business is servicing big companies with more than 1,000 employees. Enterprise customers now account for a quarter of WeWorkâs member base. Enterprise clients include Microsoft, Facebook, Starbucks, Salesforce, Pinterest, Samsung, Spotify, Sprint and more. The companyâs short, flexible leases make sense for big companies parachuting into a new market. Enterprise companies can scale new offices fast, transferring folks from other locations around the world, so it can be difficult to pin down exactly how much space they need, making flexible lease terms desirable. WeWork also serves as a release valve for companies outgrowing their permanent space. Speaker maker Sonos for the first time took space in a WeWork earlier this year as the rapid growth of its Seattle office bubbled over. Today about 40 of Sonosâ 120 Seattle employees are based in WeWorkâs Holyoke location, with the rest in the companyâs swanky Seattle office in the super green Bullitt Center. Pete Pedersen, the companyâs senior vice president of communications, said Sonos was âgrowing so darn fastâ and needed space immediately. WeWork isnât done expanding in Seattle, and it teased several more locations in non-downtown neighborhoods like Capitol Hill, Fremont and Ballard. The company wouldnât give many specifics about openings further down the line, though its websiteÂ shows a couple of other future locations: an office at the 1201 Third Ave. downtown office building and a location at Martin Selig Real Estateâs 15th + Market project now under construction in Ballard that will also be home to a new Target location and is just down the road from the first AmazonFresh Pickup location. Selig is the same developer who is hosting the first WeLive location in Seattle. The concept focuses on community living, with WeWork furnishing units that people can rent by the day, week, month or year. In 2020, the Seattle WeLive will open in Seligâs 36-story Third & Lenora tower, combined with scads of WeWork office space. Slavet didnât give much new detail about the project, mentioning it will have a shared rooftop space for all members to go along with perks like a unique fitness experience and food and beverage options. âItâs going to be a very cool experience and a flagship for us for live, work, play, all in one building, which is a big part of our founderâs vision,â Slavet said.

 Como Audio should borrow a popular tagline of âSolid Goldâ radio stations to describe its top-of-the-line music box, the Musica. This player truly offers the best of yesterday and today, harking back to the golden age of high-end, ultra-compact stereo systems while also paying heed to our current passions for streaming music from all-you-can-eat online services, Bluetooth-enabled smartphones and tablets, and NAS boxes.Â  While other home entertainment systems are eliminating CD transports and FM radio tuners from home stereo gear, the Musica includes both legacy formats. Thereâs an âautomobile gradeâ slot CD drive, that Como Audio founder Tom DeVesto says is âready for the billions of CDs still sitting on consumers shelves,â plus an on-board FM tuner with RDS (Radio Data System) support that âcan keep you connected to the world when youâre out of range of Â Wi-Fiâ (or an ethernet cable). This streaming music convert really appreciated those features on a recent weekend, when my internet service took a fall and couldnât get up âtil Monday. That outage got me listening with great pleasure to some recently acquired discsâincluding a new Bob Dylan collection of early career concert sessions (Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances from the Copyright Collections) and Â a couple of the Steven Wilson-helmed remixes of the Jethro Tull catalog (Aqualung and Songs from the Wood). The Musica is available in a wide array of classical wood veneer finishes. That stuff really came to life with the Musicaâs well-matched 3-inch voice coil woofers and 3/4-inch dome tweeters, spaced just wide enough in the 16-inch-across package to produce appreciable stereo effects, and warmed up for musicality with ported, composite (MDF) wood cabinetry. The Musica has an authentic Hi-Fi feel to it, with an uncolored accuracy and presence that lets you hear the breath propelling Ian Andersonâs flute work, or the contact âclickâ of a plastic pick strumming bronze strings on Mr. Dâs Martin guitar. In my hours of need, I also pulled up the FM whip antenna hiding on the back of the Musica to reconnect with a favorite eclectic weekend morning show (Sleepy Hollow), produced at my local (Philadelphia) non-commercial station WXPN. I canât say the radio reception was as pristine as I normally enjoy hearing the show (via its internet stream or on other house radios, which are better at filtering the hash noise from a nearby, pole-mounted power transformer). And it didnât help matters that the Musicaâs antenna can only swing to the sides and back, not forward (as I needed for optimum signal grabbing in my home setup). Still, it was better than nothing. When all is well in internet-service provider land, the Musica also offers a goodly selection of service options, including more than 30 thousand internet radio stations from around the world, many of which are commercial free. You can also access subscription fee-based versions of Spotify (with support for Spotify Connect), Tidal, Deezer, and Napster that deliver surprisingly wide-open performances through this compact system. Pandora and the streaming version of Sirius/XM (popular options on other smart speakers) are not currently onboard, though; and Amazon Music Unlimited (one of my faves) is promised as a âcoming-soonâ addition that will be delivered to current Como Audio devices via a wireless software update. Although the Musica doesn't have HDMI, you could output your TV's audio to its speakers using its digital optical cable. In the meantime, Iâve been pushing those missing links to the box from my iPad Pro via Bluetooth 4.0 with aptX, Qualcommâs âCD qualityâ encoding/decoding scheme which both the iPad and the Musica support (as both the sender and receiver must do for aptX to work). This cute thing also handles Appleâs AAC codec for the iTunes set. Designed as a centerpiece for a living-room rig, as well as the anchor for a multi-room audio system, the Musica could take a place of honor under your TV set and supplant the tellyâs crap sound with its much more refined performance, using its optical input for to connect. Two 3.5mm stereo analog inputs are also offered, along with a USB port for enjoying tunes stored on a portable hard drive. That port can also trickle-charge mobile devices, although it only puts out one amp. You can also stream music stored on network sources, such as a NAS box or a client PC, with either a wired or wireless connection to your network. Unlike most other streaming music speakers, this jack-of-all-trades is operational without an app or even the supplied (and decent) wireless remote. The Musica boasts a 3.2-inch color TFT display with a multi-language interface, as well as eight independent preset buttons for setting favorites, and three control knobs for dialing in the selections. That screen isnât all that visible from across the roomâunlike the big, bold clock time and channel/artist text presented on the display of the comparably priced Bose Wave SoundTouch Music System IV, but the Musica delivers more articulate sound. When looming close to the Musica, on the other hand, you can enjoy lots more visual information, including full color album art, artist and song IDs, and the onscreen menu system to go fishing for input and content options. The Musica is certainly not lacking for input/output connectivity on either the analog or digital front. The Musicaâs âNew Releasesâ tracker, on the other hand, is ass-backwards. Because of limited display space, users are presented with just the titles of available new albums and songs, not the names of the artists performing them. Seeing an album title like Back Roads and Abandoned Motels, or Out of the Blues, or Thicker than Water is meaningless. Seeing that Americana stalwarts The Jayhawks, blue-eyed-soulster Boz Scaggs, and jazz/funk bassist Brian Bromberg have new releases would be much more informative. Fortunately, the menus on Como Audioâs Android and iOS apps offer a much fuller picture of whoâs on first and whatâs on second. In terms of multi-room use, itâs sweet how any content playing on the Musica, including CDs and music streamed via Bluetooth, can be wirelessly whisked in synchronized fashion to upwards of four other Como Audio devicesâsuch as the recently reviewed Amicoâoperating on the same home network. The app also allows you to remotely tune in any of the eight radio station/playlist/album/podcast presets youâve established on the Musica, plus six additional sources on any Amico you might own. In the Bose SoundTouch ecosystem, the app can control up to six SoundTouch devices, but they all must share the same six presets. The Como Audio gear also is more flexible, with features such as user-customizable sound equalization options, while the Bose smart speakers rely mostly on automatic volume-related EQ. As great as it feels to manipulate the Musica's traditional knobs and buttons, sometimes you must want to sit on the couch and use a remote. I did experience a serious problem for a spell with signal dropouts on the second-room Amico speaker pulling in content that originated on the Musica, located one floor away. After several consults and equipment swap outs with my internet service provider (Comcast), the dropout issue has lessened though not entirely disappeared. Now I might experience two brief blink outs of music per hour. Â So no, a Como Audio system isnât quite as stable as a Sonos setup. There were also a couple of times where I had to resort to rebooting the Como products after an internet outage, situations where other gear bounced back on its own. And Como Audioâs app can be a tad sluggish, especially when serving up content from subscription services. The apps from Sonos and Bose load faster. What ultimately makes me a Musica fan is how versatile and user friendly it is. How good the system sounds, punching far above its size and weight class. And yes, how pretty it looks. A girl friend who hardly notices the black boxes I test stopped in her tracks when she saw the pale hickory-wood-veneered Musica. âNow thatâs one Iâd like to have in my house,â she said. If you can take just one piece of electronics to your mountain cabin or  desert island, the Como Audio Musica would be a good choice. It plays everything, sounds delicious, and looks pretty, too.

Rotel A12 Integrated Amplifier And Rotel CD14 CD Player
Rotel's dynamic duo delivers outstanding performance for their price.
Review By Dwayne Carter         This
review is proof that you can 'go home again'. This review of the Rotel A12
integrated amplifier with the Rotel CD14 CD is proof of that ($899 and $599
respectively). When asked to review the new line of Rotel products, the answer
should always be yes. Not having had the opportunity to review any of their
products in a long time, my thoughts drifted back to many years ago (a lifetime,
really). My last review was of the  Rotel RCD-971 CD player. That was 17 years ago. Seventeen! My life is
so different now. Everything has changed...Everything, except Rotel. The Rotel
brand is like a Volvo, and that's not such a bad thing. A few months ago, my
friendly Fed Ex man dropped of the two, white, non-descript boxes: Fed Ex Man: ""New toys, huh""? Me: ""Yep."" Fed Ex Man: ""Anything cool""? Me: ""Always my friend... always.""   My Fed Ex man was happy it wasn't a pair of 300 pound exotic
floorstanding speakers (which I'm still waiting on Steven... my dear Creative
Director and friend). Let's begin with the privilege of unwrapping and unboxing of the new
Rotel A12 Integrated Amplifier and Rotel CD14 CD Player. For the purpose of this
review, these two components were viewed as a matched system. The Rotel A12 Integrated Amplifier and CD14 CD Player arrived
in separate boxes. Upon opening both boxes, you will find a stiff cardboard
cover sheet. Flip this over, and you will find a clearly written ""Quick
Installation Guide"". This thin piece of cardboard will make you very happy. With
many pieces of review gear; the anticipation has me (literally) twitching
through the unboxing process. High-end doesn't have to mean high drama. Three
minutes into the unboxing process (and a few glances at the ""Quick Installation
Guide"") and you will already know 95% of everything you need to know, about
hooking up these two components. This is a pleasing and welcoming change of
pace.   Rotel CD14 CD Player
If you've ever owned or demo'ed a Rotel piece of gear, your
flashback (like mine), will began upon lifting the component free of its
cardboard confinements. Here's an excerpt from my review of the Rotel RCD-971 CD
player: ""The Rotel RCD-971 CD
Player is a rather thin, sleek looking machine. It has the typical buttons and
knobs, but with a nice, minimalist look, fit and finish. On the back, you will
find the usual, single analog audio connectors and a single, coaxial S/PDF
digital output. It is also as thin as a typical novel but deceptively heavy and
well built. Rotel has been known for their sturdy (almost industrial) look,
solid performance and reasonable prices.""      Staring at the new Rotel CD 14, the description is virtually
unchanged. While the review sample of Rotel's CD14 is black, the earlier RCD-971
was silver, but that's about the most obvious difference. Of course inside each
unit is a completely different story, as technology has made a few improvements
in the past seventeen years. Taking a glance at the front, you'll find the power
button on the left, and the remaining selections of buttons on the right (play,
pause, stop, eject and track forward and reverse). Flip to the rear, and you
will find the analog RCA out, and a S/PDIF (Coax) digital output. Less used, but
equally important, are the Rotel Link, RS-232, and 12V trigger. In the very far
corner; the power plug. Inside, the CD 14 boasts the premium high performance Wolfson
DAC chip (24-bit/192kHz), usually found on much more expensive devices. Rounding
out the inside, the standard plastic disc tray (remember the metal ones...
[sigh]) and their proprietary voltage/current power supply. The player comes
with a basic remote (the Rotel RRD-99). This is your standard remote, with
nicely spaced buttons. The layout of buttons (separate on/off, eject, stop, Rev,
FF, etc.), are right where you think they should be. Playing a CD was as simple
a task as it should be. Your thumb will quickly and easily find the play button
(among others). No drama.   The Rotel A12 Integrated Amplifier
Next to come out of the box was the Rotel A12 integrated
amplifier. The same description can be said about the integrated amplifier, as
the CD 14 player. The unit feels well built, with nearly flush-mounted buttons.
As with Rotel's CD14 CD player, you will find the power button on the left,
along with a USB port and headphone jack (3.5mm). Speaker selections (A and/or
B) complete the left side, while the right side houses the volume control and
menu buttons. Flipping around back you will find an array of inputs and outputs.      The A12 integrated amplifier is flush with twelve (12) inputs
(Phono, CD, Tuner, USB, Optical 1, Optical 2, Coax 1, Coax 2, BT, PC-USB, Aux 1,
and finally Aux 2). That's packing a lot into such a small enclosure. Rounding
out the back, you will find two coax (S/PDIF) inputs as well as two optical (TosLink)
inputs, two sets of speaker terminals and a Bluetooth antenna (for APTX
connections). Rotel Link (input and output for control of other Rotel devices),
a USB-PC and a USB power only port as well. Hooking this to an automation
system? You're covered with the RS-232 port.      It's hard to believe that this is some of Rotel's
entry-level(!) offerings. All inputs (as well as direct Tone Control, Bass, Treble,
Balance and Bypass) are directly accessed through the full sized remote. In a
nice change of pace; most functions are accessible from the front buttons as
well. As with the CD14, there is nothing wrong with the remote. The Rotel A12
remote (the RRAX-1400), looks virtually identical to the CD14 remote. They
appear to be cast from the same shell. Obviously, with twelve (12) inputs, the
A12 remote is a bit more densely packed. Like most product remotes, after the
initial setup, only the basic buttons are used going forward.   All Together Now: Rotel CD14 CD Player
& A12 Integrated Amplifier
Since reviewing both units at the same time, they were stacked
with the A12 integrated amplifier on top of the CD14 CD player. This allows the
heat generated from the amplifier to easily exit at the top of the unit. Like
the ads you'll most likely see for these products; the combo of the A12 and CD14
make a very attractive couple; easily fitting into most home décor. They appear
very Euro style. Very Ikea-like (but in a good way). The CD/amp combo would fit
well, into any home in Europe, Japan or China; because China is where they are
made. By looks alone, many people assume Rotel is a European
product. They just look that way. It's akin to walking through an international
airport. With any world experience, you can usually detect who is from where.
Very stylish cloths, walking slowly... probably European. Dressed in yellow and
green from head to toe? Greenbay Wisconsin. Mowing you over, then acting like it
was your fault? Probably New York, yet it could be Enjoy
the Music.com's Creative Editor Steven R. Rochlin running to his next
flight. This may be a generalization, yet European components tend to look like
they are from Europe. You don't often confuse a Ferrari F1 with a Toyota Corolla
now do you? Rotel started as a Japanese OEM manufacturer in the 1950s, then
eventually moved to China in the 1990s (where it remains today). Rotel is made
in China. Please stop making that face, and move on.   Good Things Come To Those Who Wait
Many great devices come from china. There's a very good
chance, you are reading this review on a Mac product. Guess where that was made?
Are you lucky enough to own the awesome  Questyle QP-1R
DAP? Guess
where that was made? In the same factory as your Mac and iPhone (in China).
In finding good sounding gear, it is less important
about where the components were assembled, than how and what individual
components were assembled into a device. What is assembled inside of the Rotel
A12 integrated amplifier and CD14 player gives a nod to their more expensive
brethren. It is important to note that the A12 and CD14 are considered the
entry-level for Rotel. Rarely have many of us been exposed to Rotel's powerful
RMB-1585 amplifier or RSP-1582 flagship processor (hint, hint dear friend Steven
R Rochlin]. Call it pin-point marketing or company strategy; most of us are only
exposed to their entry-level line. The Rotel A12 integrated amplifier has most of the components
from the more expensive and slightly more powerful A14, but lacks the true
streaming capabilities and higher resolution DSD support. This is due to the A12's
24-bit/192kHz Wolfson WM8740SEDS DAC versus the upper line A14 (more expensive)
AKM 32-bit/768kHz DAC. The Rotel A14 ($1299) does support 32-bit /384kHz DSD
resolution, if this is what you desire.      Connecting the Rotel A12 integrated amplifier and CD14 CD
player together was very easy. Initial setup was made using the S/PDIF coax
digital output from the CD14 player to the S/PDIF digital input of the A12. This
setup allows the CD14 to act as a transport, therefore allowing the A12 DAC to
do the conversions. Later, switching this setup to use the analog RCA outputs of
the CD14 into the RCA CD input of the A12 will test the characteristics of the
CD14's Wolfson chip. Since both units were brand new, burn-in was a must!
Currently having on hand a pair of new Vermouth Audio's Little Lucas speakers
for review, it was a great opportunity to burn everything in at the same time.
Look for the upcoming review of the Vermouth Audio Little Lucas speakers next
month or thereabouts. Initial burn-in was about 120 hours. For burn-in sources I
first used the typical test CD followed by a self-made disc comprised of over 50
rock, classical, folk and new wave tracks. The MP3 CD was loaded into the Rotel
CD14 CD player and placed on repeat. After five days of this treatment it was
time for some serious listening. Starting with the CD input, and quickly cycling
through all the inputs, the A12 had virtually silent switching. As stated; all
inputs (as well as direct Tone control, Bass, Treble, Balance and Bypass) can be
directly accessed through the full sized remote, as well as directly from the
front faceplate.   At First Listen... 
Initial audio observations were made using the burn-in MP3 CD.
After the first hour, my notepad had just a few observations; ""tight, very tight""
and ""choking"". Knowing better than to add too many unknowns while
troubleshooting; my well-used, well-known Jamo Concert 8 bookshelf speakers were
swapped in for the Vermouth Audio, ""Little Lucas"" speakers. Hitting play again,
the room was soon filled with the Rotel sound you should come to expect. The
Rotel sound to me, always have a nice, smooth, uncolored sound. Basically flat,
in spectrum. They have full midrange, defined (but slightly muted) highs, and
safe, firm sounding base. Safe like a Volvo (and that's not such a bad thing).
Apparently, the Vermouth Audio, ""Little Lucas"" speakers needed more burn-in time
(they were moved to my office rig, to continue to burn-in). Eagerly flipping from CD to CD, the hours and days progressed
nicely. We have all read about the dying days of the CD. Remember, that was also
said about the LP, and look what happened? Like the LP, listening to music on a
CD has a bit of nostalgia feel. Days were spent reading (small) cover art, while
listening to a CD in its entirety. Who does that anymore? Many have forgotten
the feeling of listening to an artist work, from beginning to end. Long ago (in
my studio days), we would agonize for days (sometimes weeks) over the albums
track order. Now, we just play a track or two, from our list of files. Listening
to track after track, without any framework or storyline; loses a bit of the
artistry in making music. That's just this humble reviews opinion. Throughout the CD source listening experience (WAV
16-bit/44.1kHz), the Rotel CD14 was steady and unflinching in its delivery. As a
transport, the CD14 matched well with the A12. Although wanting to test the CD14
Players DAC, this was saved for last. Surrounded by stacks of CDs, it was a
perfect time to be surrounded by stacks of albums. When you happen to have a
Rotel A12 integrated amplifier (with a phono input), and Oracle Audio's newest
Turntable (the Origine) on hand at the same time, you use them! (Look for my
World Premiere review of the Oracle Audio Origine coming soon). The Rotel A12 features a moving-magnet phono input, and
eventually mated with the Origine turntable, after a bit of tweaking. Component
matching is a critical step in designing a good sounding audio setup. Add a
turntable to the mix, and you will need to do a little more homework. Obviously
you need to know your turntable cartridge specs; be it a MM (moving magnet) or a
MC (moving coil). The Oracle Audio's Origine shipped with the Ortofon Blue
cartridge, which is a MM cartridge, so connecting the Origine to the A12 was
very simple. The Ortofon Blue cartridge is known for its balance tone and
overall full-range resolution. Having listened to several days of music with
this cartridge; the Ortofon Blue's balanced characteristics would mate well with
the A12. Since most of my record collection is from the 1980s, it's safe to
assume they suffered through a lot of college misuse and abuse. Re-starting my
analog journey with some new vinyl last Christmas (by purchasing a few new LP's
from Acoustic Sounds); it was time to put them through the paces. Ordering Beth
Hart's 37 Days (180 gram) for my
wife plus Bruce Hornsby and The Range The Way
It Is for myself [APRV 30118 and AEXH 44072 respectively], I thus
started my analog listening session on a high quality high note. Since both LP's
are new 180 gram pressings they should sound excellent. As the majority of the LP had been recorded live in the
studio, Beth Hart's ""37 Days"" LP can bellowing through the Jamo Concert 8
speakers once the Phono input on the A12 was selected. Live recordings are
difficult to do (at best) and can be very revealing. Beth Hart's strong, raspy
vocals came through clearly on the Jamo Concert 8 speakers, as well as all
headphones (my preferred choice, being the intimacy of the Noble Audio K10
CIEMs). The Bruce Hornsby and The Range LP The
Way It Is produced no unexpected surprises; just clear, but slightly
muted sound. The studio recording's sound performance was equally enjoyable as
the live recording from Beth Hart. Spinning several LP's from my 1980s
collection produced the same pleasant results. The overall sound quality and
dynamic punch was diminished, probably due to the 1980s pressing and abuse, yet
still enjoyable. Over the next few days, listened to over 18 LPs from classical
to punk rock, was a welcome departure from (sometimes) sterile laptop playback
mechanism. Part of the ritual of playing an LP, is the cleaning of the LP. My
Record Doctor made short work of this necessary task; but it also forces one to
slow down a bit. Like with the CD's, the enjoyment of reading all of those liner
notes, will not soon be forgotten.      Wanting to compare the sound quality of the built-in A12's
phono stage, with a stand-alone preamplifier; the phono interconnects to the A12
were disconnected, and re-connected to the Parasound Phono Preamplifier. My
signal path was simple. Out of the Oracle Audio's Origine Turntable via
Audioquest Tier 4 Big Sur RCA cables, then into the Parasound Zphono Phono
Preamplifier, and lastly out to the AUX1 input of the A12 integrated amplifier. As expected, the Parasound
Zphono Phono Preamplifier produced a wider, richer soundstage; but it would have
been a bit disappointed if it hadn't. The point of having a built-in phono
input, is to avoid having to purchase a separate Phono Preamplifier. Unless you
are a hardcore vinyl spinner, the A12 phono inputs will work just fine for you.
One could also point out the (possible) electronic sonic mismatch, of connecting
a (low) four figure turntable to an integrated amplifier's built-in phono input
(costing about a quarter as much), but we all have our crosses to bare. Reluctantly, putting away the analog gear, it was time to turn
my attention back to the digital world. It was time for Bluetooth and USB
connectivity. The A12 does allow for aptX connections for streaming (think Red
Book quality). Not being a huge fan of Bluetooth streaming a review of the
actually had to review the connection instructions was needed to get everything
working properly. The manual states that the A12 is capable of 384kHz/32-bit,
but really only supports 24-bit192kHz. (Note: The A14 model does support the
higher resolutions). The Rotel App was mentioned in the manual, but requires a
network connection (not available on the A12). The app would work well with the
A14 since that model has an Ethernet port. The A12 allows a Bluetooth connection
with aptX support. Alas, the Apple iPhone doesn't support aptX, so standard
(SBC) Bluetooth connectivity was used. Bluetooth aptX connection promises
CD-quality sound. My standard Bluetooth connection sounded a bit more
compressed, like MP3 sound quality (at its best). No real lows or mid-lows, no
highs to speak of. This sound quality would be fine for background noise. On
Rotel's A12, you can choose fixed or variable volume levels, so the BT (Bluetooth) input
would take full advantage of this option. The connection was strong, and stayed
connected throughout my Bluetooth audition time. My Review Test List has a lot of DSD files, but it was easy to
make a modified version of the 'List' by omitting or converting the DSD and
other unsupported files. My Review Demo collection currently includes over forty
songs (which will be repeated, over and over again) so it took me a while to
down convert a lot of them to 24-bit/192kHz. My setup was now the Apple MacBook
Pro (2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) running OS 10.11.5, with
AudirvanaPlus Software, pulling files from a Synology 16TB NAS Server. The
connection was an Audioquest Carbon USB cable, into the Rotel A12 USB-PC port.
Following standard process, the revised demo list was auditioned in order.
Starting with Michael Jackson's Thriller
(all files converted to 24-bit/192kHz), on to Tom Petty's Full
Moon Fever, Billy Joel's The
Stranger and then, Leclair's Sonata
for 2 Violins in G Major. A new demo list, let's call it ""Demo of
Destruction"", consists of beam splitting bass tracks (try ""Don't
Let Me Down"" [featuring Daya
re-mix] and ""Never Forget You"" [MNEK
Re-Mix]). While this demo list was assembled to demoralize weak
speakers (and show off my new SVS Ultra 13 subwoofer), the A12 handled the
tracks quite well, considering it outputs just 60 Watts per channel stereo.   Let's Get Serious
The A12 integrated amplifier outputs just 60 Watts per
channel. That's nice power for an amp of this size, but you will have to be
careful with your speaker selection. Speaker choices for me tend to gravitate
towards the power sucking, amp-draining type. Currently my power drain of choice
is the Martin Logan Summits. When paired together, the Rotel A12 and Martin
Logan Summits did not play well together. To that end, even after another four
weeks of break-in the Vermouth Audio ""Little Lucas"" speakers and the A12 did not
go on a second date either. The majority of my speaker listening was done with
my old Jamo Concert 8 (D830) speakers that present a 4 Ohm and are 90dB/W/m sensitivity
with a
frequency response from 38Hz to 22kHz. They are, of course, mounted on rigid
high-end audio quality stands. Late night listening
was auditioned with Meze 99 Classics headphones and Noble Audio K10 custom
in-ear monitors (CIEMs). Throughout the USB-PC input listening sessions, the overall
sound quality remained the same. As is my reviewing custom, tone control is
tested, but not used. All detents are in the 12'oclock position. Balance is
centered. Testing the tone controls produced the standard, slow gain, in both
the treble and the bass. Listening for several days through the Apple MacBook /
Audirvana Plus Software / Synology NAS setup; the Rotel combo had a consistently
pleasing soundstage. The timbre and color of the sound stage was just shy of
warm; ceding this (much sought after) destination to tube amps and players.      No matter the source (except for Bluetooth), the A12 exuded
the sound qualities attribute to what we now call around my house the ""Rotel""
sound. To my ears, the ""Rotel Sound"" (and thus the A12/CD14) describes a clean,
Mid-bass and midrange. Vocals are always clear and well defined. The Bass is a
small bit soft punchy, with melodic tones and adequate decay. Sub-bass is
present, but not upfront. Attacks were direct, but never harsh to the ears. This
is especially true in the mid to high treble range. Being a former
percussionist, attacks and decays are given special attention, and this can
become a problem. Reviewing takes a lot of time. This means long hours of
listening, without fatigue, is always a goal. Listening to music in long 4 to 12
hour sessions, fatigue is an always a possible obstacle. The Rotel combo was
never an assault on my ears. It was a respite. As promised, before wrapping up the review; connecting the RCA
outputs of the CD14 player to the CD input of the A12 (via Audioquest Big Sir
RCA cables) will allow the testing of the on-board DAC. Being a fan of CD
players and high-quality CD player/Transports in general; the Holy Grail will
always be a CD Player/Transport built like a tank, has a metal disc tray, and an
upgradeable DAC. To my knowledge, this beast doesn't exist (Note: Readers, if you
know of such a unit, contact me!). The Rotel CD14 is not such a beast, nor was
it designed to be. The CD 14 plays your typical Red Book CDs and MP3 files only.
No, it doesn't play SACD software. What the CD 14 does do well is play Compact
Discs. They sound good. Really good! Generally, a good piece of electronic gear
is the sum of all it's parts. That's why in this review you will not find a
comparison of this brand DAC versus that brand DAC, this chip with that chip.
Simply put, the goal is to review the combination of the Rotel A12 integrated
amplifier with its CD14 stable mate. Since both are sporting the premium Wolfson
24-bit/192kHz DAC a huge difference wasn't expected. From earlier evaluation,
tracking would not be an issue, either. The CD14 tracks very well for a player
in this price range.   A Final Listen
The final listening session was reserved for a few newly
purchased CDs, following this year's AXPONA in Chicago. You always hear some
unique demo material you should own, and this year was no exception. Post-show
purchases included SONOSings by Sonos [ASN: B002JCMZDC] and an older CD ""Sweet
Tea"" by Buddy Guy [ASN: B00005CC2J]. Sonos (now called Arora) is a vocal group
based out of Los Angeles. They sing mostly acapella, with assistance of effect
pedals. On the SONOSings CD, the
track ""Re:
Stacks"" caught my ear during an Axpona demo. Female vocals tend to be
more difficult to reproduce with accuracy, and the CD14 had no problems in doing
so. Singing mostly in the midrange to mid-high range (Messo Soprano and
Contralto), this CD is a collection of excellent tracks for anyone looking to
reveal any audio system issues. It's filled with stunning, natural harmonies and
layer upon layer of vocal melodies. This is a highly recommended CD for any
audiophile. Buddy Guy's gritty, live studio performance comes
through dangerous and ominous as was intended. Played through vintage amplifiers
and what one can imagine to be a beaten, well-worn classic guitars, this classic
blues album was a late afternoon thrill. ""Done
Got Old"" is a new, personal favorite. On this acoustic treat, Buddy
Guys guttural growl creeps solidly in the mid-bass range, highlighted by the
twang and pluck of the guitar strings. Only slightly more detail was heard, when
playing this track on a much more expensive setup. You would have to quadruple
your investment to hear it, though. Did the CD14's internal DAC sound as good as
the A12's DAC? No. Did it sound different? Not really. Did it sound good? Yes.
Yes it did. The preferred setup for this reviewer would be to use the CD14 as a
transport. S/PDIF output into the A12. No technical reason given, as the DAC on
the Rotel CD14 sounds as good as the DAC on the Rotel A12. It's just a personal
taste. It may come from years of listening to poor quality CD DACs. You will be
happy with either setup.   Same Same...
After several months with the Rotel combo, a bit of melancholy
filled the house as the white NAD boxes were retrieved from the garage. The
Rotel combo had become a wanted fixture in our home. We can all agree that there
is some piece (or pieces) of gear in our audio rig that require a bit of work to
enjoy. A constant tweak here, a little TLC there. It may even become a bit of a
chore to enjoy. Come on, you know which component(s) I'm taking about. You paid
a lot for it, so you dare not speak ill of it. So the gear sits. This was not
the case with the Rotel A12 integrated amplifier and Rotel CD14 CD player. Using
either Rotel remote (with the A12 and the CD14 connected via the Rotel Link
cable), I had music playing before I put my keys down. We'd become accustom to
the ""Rotel Sound"". Solid bass, clear mid-range, (very slightly) muted treble and
plenty of power to achieve party-time volume levels. At this price range you are
delivered one of the best sounding performances. Every time, with no fuss or muss.
A guy can get used to that! That level of dependability with a great
price-performance ratio is a hard thing to come by these days. The Rotel combo was reliable, like a Toyota, and that's not
such a bad thing.   Review Gear During This Review
