A new Netflix reality series following the lavish lives of nine wealthy, light-skinned socialites in Mexico City has provoked a backlash from critics who say it's tone-deaf in a country where most have darker skin and about half the population lives in poverty. 
""Trash,"" ''filth,"" ''pathetic,"" ''classist,"" were some of the more polite adjectives Twitter users employed to describe their reaction to the show, ""Made in Mexico."" 
Critics are also questioning the timing of the streaming service's first Mexican reality show, announced a little over a month after the country overwhelmingly elected as president the leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who rails against what he calls an entrenched and corrupt elite and promises to make the poor his top priority. 
""In the last elections we showed that we live in a democratic country. Nonetheless, we still suffer terrible atavisms related to classism and, what's worse, racism,"" said Guadalupe Loaeza, who has written several books about the Mexican elite. ""More than money, the color of one's skin is definitive ... for whether one is accepted or not among the 'rich boys and girls.'"" 
""Made in Mexico"" producers did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
But Hanna Jaff, a 30-year-old, San Diego-born Mexican philanthropist, speaker and human rights activist, told The Associated Press that she and the other cast members are representative of Mexico as family people with different backgrounds and professions and ""our own problems within our circumstances."" 
She said the show will offer a positive, intellectual, entrepreneurial vision of the country, in contrast to what's often seen in media such as Netflix, which hosts a number of violent narco-dramas such as ""El Chapo,"" about notorious Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaquin Guzman Loera. 
""I wanted the world to see a different Mexico, from a different point of view,"" Jaff said. ""I think there will always be negative and positive people, no? ... And in truth, the program is not a stereotype."" 
At least in early advertising, however, Netflix has been touting it somewhat differently: ""Get to know the opulent lifestyles and infamous dynasties of Mexico City's socialites and the expats vying for a spot in their exclusive social order,"" reads the teaser for the show in the app. 
Some have also objected to its English-language title, an affectation common in magazines and advertising aimed at well-to-do Mexicans. Besides Jaff, at least two other cast members are reportedly American. 
The white and the wealthy have long dominated Mexican media, from telenovelas to newscasts to high-society supplements of national newspapers that chronicle fancy weddings, galas and mansions, with hardly a dark-skinned face to be found. 
Loaeza referenced what are known in the country as ""mirreyes"" â a motherly expression meaning roughly ""my little kings"" â the flashy young scions of wealth and privilege known for sharing photos of luxurious cars, clothes, vacations and bling on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The phenomenon has taken off in recent years, amplified by the explosion of social media and accompanied by a number of corruption scandals during the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto. 
""These 'new rich' are totally aspirational, even though they are criticized,"" Loaeza said. ""Many people aspire to dress like them, to spend holidays in Acapulco and drive a BMW."" 
So despite the criticism in a country of stark social and economic contrasts â where telecoms magnate Carlos Slim is one of the richest people in the world, while millions in places like Chiapas and Oaxaca live in ramshackle homes â ""Made in Mexico"" could well become a hit when it is released Sept. 28. 
""I think that precisely because most of the population is so far from that, it makes people really curious about what it feels like to be in that person's place,"" said Jorge Romero, a 25-year-old Netflix user. 
Christopher Alcantara, a 32-year-old business administrator, said he's curious to see ""Made in Mexico"" and added that such shows are entertaining and introduce new slang and fashion trends. 
""Morbidity sells, and without a doubt it would be very interesting to watch a pilot episode,"" Alcantara said.",0.073,0.83,0.096,0.9138

The frustratingly long wait for Tamara Jenkins' follow-up to her 2007 Oscar-nominated film, ""The Savages,"" seemed to finally be coming to end. She had spent two years on the script to ""Private Life,"" and secured Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti to star as a middle-aged New York couple navigating the medical and emotional gauntlet of assisted reproduction. But just when the production was ready to go, the company that had developed it, Amazon Studios, stepped back, leaving Jenkins in the lurch. 
Enter Netflix. 
""I think 'swooped' would be the perfect word. They saved it,"" says Jenkins, the 56-year-old filmmaker of ""The Slums of Beverly Hills."" ''I was scared. I thought we're going to blow it. We were going to miss the window. And then Netflix said, 'We'll do it' and they said it incredibly fast."" 
Jenkins' ""Private Life"" (Oct. 5) is part of what may be the most extensive fall movie slate any studio has ever put together. Between September and Christmas, Netflix will release at least 25 films. There will be one or two new movies released almost every week, many of them by the most sought-after filmmakers in Hollywood. 
Among them: Nicole Holofcener's midlife crisis drama ""The Land of Steady Habits"" (Sept. 14), Jeremy Saulnier's northern Alaska thriller ""Hold the Dark"" (Sept. 28), Paul Greengrass' docudrama on the 2011 Norway terrorist attack ""22 July"" (Oct. 10), David Mackenzie's Robert the Bruce epic ""Outlaw King"" (Nov. 9), Joel and Ethan Coen's Western anthology film ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" (Nov. 16) and Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity"" follow-up ""Roma."" And that's not even mentioning a new work, the posthumously completed ""The Other Side of the Wind,"" from a long-unheard-from filmmaker: Orson Welles. 
A year after ""Mudbound"" became Netflix's biggest Oscar contender yet, the streaming giant's programming push (it's spending some $8 billion in 2018) is heading into this year's awards season with a wave of prestige and genre-movie reinforcements. Whether the Netflix tide will roll all the way into the Academy Awards remains to be seen. (Some, like Steven Spielberg, have suggested Netflix films, with their small, token theatrical releases, are more like TV movies and should qualify for the Emmys, not the Oscars.) 
But regardless, the Netflix powerhouse fall lineup would be the envy of most any studio. It's a significant surge for a company with an up-and-down record in terms of the quality of its original films. (See: ""Bright,"" ''War Machine"" or any of the Adam Sandler movies.) And though critics have claimed Netflix releases can get lost in its sea of programming options, it will be hard to miss the Netflix movies this fall. There will be six Netflix films at the Venice Film Festival and eight at the Toronto International Film Festival. 
""I usually turn it on its head and say: Look, movies are found on Netflix,"" says Ian Bricke, co-head of Netflix's indie film division. ""And it's certainly important for us, too, that these movies are in the culture. 'Private Life' was at Sundance, will be at the New York Film Festival, will be in theaters. It will be written about and experienced and talked about in a way that any other film would be, and can reach potentially, over a very short period of time, a really meaningful audience all over the world. To me, that's the best of both worlds."" 
Cuaron's much anticipated ""Roma"" had been headed for Cannes. But after Netflix pulled its films from the French festival after Cannes ruled them out from the main competition, ""Roma"" will instead hit the Venice, Toronto and the New York festivals before arriving on Netflix in December. For the Mexican filmmaker of ""Gravity"" and ""Children of Men,"" the '70s-set, black-and-white, Spanish-language ""Roma"" is a bold departure that forced Cuaron to remake himself as a filmmaker. 
But like Jenkins' ""Private Life,"" Cuaron's deeply personal film, about the Mexico City neighborhood of his youth, was never going to be an easy sell to distributors. Netflix, where original films are typically watched by millions, meant a global release far beyond the art house. Cuaron calls Neflix's support of ""Roma"" ''unprecedented."" 
""The specialized film, the so-called foreign film market nowadays is very challenging and sometimes their resources are limited,"" says Cuaron ""Netflix fully believe in the film and they understand these kinds of films can have a huge audience. So now they are in a creative and aggressive way supporting the film. What they offered was absolutely compelling. I'm really, really grateful for them."" 
For Cuaron, making ""Roma,"" about a domestic worker for a middle-class family, was part of connecting again with the ""personal journey"" of cinema. He estimates 90 percent of it is based on his memories. He went to great lengths to recreate his childhood home. None of the crew or cast had a script. 
""It's something that's been brewing for a long, long, long time,"" he says of the film. 
Jenkins, too, was pulling from her own experience for ""Private Life."" The film is partly based on the pregnancy trials of her own with her husband, the screenwriter Jim Taylor. Even though it wasn't Jenkins' initial instinct to dramatize that chapter of her life. 
""When I was kind of downloading my woes or whatever, a girlfriend of mine who's a filmmaker said, 'Oh my god, you should really write about that.' And I was like, 'No way! I'll never do that! Gross!'"" says Jenkins. But as she witnessed more friends going through similar fertility challenges, she reconsidered. ""There was something so existential about that problem. It's so primal. I just thought it was a great lens to examine this couple."" 
Both ""Private Life"" and Holofcener's ""The Land of Steady Habits"" were abandoned in development elsewhere when they were picked up by Bricke and his colleague Matt Levin. Without consulting content chief Ted Sarandos, they can greenlight anything with a budget under $10 million. 
""We have a business model and an appetite for creative risk that's not unique but is relatively scarce,"" says Bricke. ""When a Charlie Kauffman or a Tamara Jenkins or a Nicole Holofcener comes around, it's pretty easy for us to jump in with them."" 
Holofcener's film stars Ben Mendelsohn as Anders Hill, a Connecticut man who has left his wife (Edie Falco), quit his job in finance and begun acting recklessly. Based on Ted Thompson's novel, it's the first adaptation for Holofcener, the writer-director of ""Enough Said"" and ""Friends With Money,"" and the first centered on a man. 
""I absolutely identify with him, as a parent, as a divorced parent, who inevitably is going to make mistakes,"" says Holofcener."" I like to think I don't make such serious mistakes or catastrophic mistakes as Anders makes. But we're all so flawed and stumbling along on our own and trying to be role models for our kids. They go whatever way they want and we can't control them. It's scary. I relate to that in him. I'm nicer than he is, I like to think, and not as screwed up. But that's what makes a good movie, right?""

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Netflix is considering giving ""Roma,"" the Alfonso CuarÃ³n-directed Oscar contender, an exclusive theatrical run before premiering it on the service for streaming. This would be a sharp pivot from its original plans, which were to make it available to stream the same day it ran in select theaters (called ""day and date"").   In fact, that's been Netflix's usual policy, which has never landed the company in the good graces of theatrical chains. Because of this policy, most major theater chains have refused to play Netflix movies. That stands in contrast to competitor Amazon, which gives its original movies exclusive theatrical runs before streaming (and has reaped the rewards at the Oscars).   Anonymous sources told THR that Netflix film chief Scott Stuber is pushing head of content Ted Sarandos to give the movie, and others from high-profile filmmakers, an extended theatrical run prior to its debut on Netflix in order to improve Netflix's awards-season chances and make those filmmakers happy.   Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider and declined to comment to THR.   Netflix once flirted with the idea of buying Landmark Theaters in order to guarantee its movies play in theaters, but ultimately passed on the chance. And Business Insider reported in April that Netflix had rejected offers to play its films at some arthouse theaters, possibly out of fear of underperforming.   Netflix's lack of theatrical distribution has been a headache for the company. Earlier this year, Netflix pulled out of the Cannes Film Festival after a new rule disqualified any film without a theatrical distribution in France.   Netflix has been attracting top talent in the industry to boost its profile. Along with CuarÃ³n and Greengrass, Netflix is premiering movies from the Coen Brothers and more at the Venice Film Festival, which began on Wednesday. But now it needs to keep them happy.   ""Roma"" does not have a release date yet, but was expected to arrive on Netflix and in select theaters later this year. Netflix's official description of the movie is, ""A story that chronicles a tumultuous year in the life of a middle-class family in Mexico City in the early 1970s.""

It will premiere six movies at the fest.   The movies hail from respected and Oscar-winning filmmakers like Alfonso CuarÃ³n and the Coen Brothers. In fact, Netflix no doubt has its sights on the Oscars this year: you don't finance films from such directors and premiere them at Venice if you're not thinking about awards season.   While the streamer's ""Icarus"" won best documentary this year (Netflix's only Oscar win so far), Netflix and the Oscars have been a controversial topic in the past. Director Steven Spielberg proclaimed that Netflix films deserve Emmys, not Oscars, because ""once you commit to a television format, you're a TV movie."" Netflix also pulled out of the Cannes Film Festival after it introduced a rule change, in which any film without a theatrical distribution in France would be disqualified from competition.   But Venice has rejuvenated Netflix's Oscar hopes, and the Toronto International Film Festival next month will show seven Netflix movies, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  We've rounded up the six Netflix movies showing at Venice below (Most don't have official release dates yet, but are all expected to arrive on Netflix later this year): Director: Alfonso CuarÃ³n (""Gravity,"" ""Children of Men,"" ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"")  Netflix description: ""A story that chronicles a tumultuous year in the life of a middle-class family in Mexico City in the early 1970s.""

Guy Pearce, who stars in the new Netflix original ""The Innocents,"" said in  an interview with Empire Magazine's film podcast (via  IndieWire) that the company told him not to use the phrase ""binge-watching"" while promoting the series.   ""I don't think Netflix likes the term 'binge,'"" Pearce said when Empire asked him if viewers would binge-watch ""The Innocents."" ""When we did the promotion for ['The Innocents'] in the [United States], we were strictly sort of instructed beforehand not to talk about 'binge-watching.'""   Pearce didn't elaborate on Netflix's reasoning for the policy, but one assumes that the company has taken issue with the term ""binge"" for its connection to disorders like binge-eating and binge-drinking. (Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter from Business Insider.)   It's unclear exactly where the phrase ""binge-watching"" originated. But Netflix did use the phrase in a  press release as early as December 2013, the year it released its first big original series, ""House of Cards,"" in promoting survey results that found binge-watching was a ""widespread behavior"" among TV audiences.

Starting at $22/month for 24 months, the subscription program comes with an Xbox One S console, two years of Xbox Live Gold service, and two years of Xbox Game Pass access. There's a second, more expensive tier as well, which comes with the aforementioned $500 Xbox One X console, two years of Xbox Live Gold service, and two years of Xbox Game Pass Access — priced at $35/month for 24 months. You own the console outright at the end of the 24-month term.   Both plans offer savings over buying the console and services piecemeal: The Xbox One S plan costs approximately $530 across 24 months, while buying each piece individually would cost nearly $650; the Xbox One X plan costs approximately $840 across 24 months, while buying each piece individually would cost approximately $860.   It's a bold move from Microsoft: The Xbox One is now the most affordable option for a gaming console by far. Even used PlayStation 4 consoles cost over $200 a pop, and Nintendo's Switch starts at $300.   More importantly, All Access comes with both Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass — Microsoft's flagship subscription services for gaming — for the length of your subscription,.   You need Xbox Live Gold to play online, making it a must for many on that basis alone. But Xbox Live Gold also comes with additional perks like discounts on downloadable games, and a quartet of free games for your console every month.   Meanwhile, Game Pass opens the door to a huge library of downloadable games from a growing list of hundreds of original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One titles. It's kind of like Netflix for gaming, except games are downloaded instead of streamed. You keep access to every title as long as you're subscribed.   Game Pass is especially important because every major Microsoft-published game arrives on Game Pass the same day as launch, including new entries in the ""Halo,"" ""Gears of War,"" and ""Forza"" series. When ""Forza Horizon 4"" drops later this year, for example, Game Pass subscribers will get it on day one for no additional charge.  In the Netflix comparison, first-party Microsoft games are the equivalent of Netflix producing its own content.                                            Microsoft                                      In so many words, subscribing to Xbox All Access is an all-in-one way to buy a new Xbox console with a ton of games right out of the box.                                                                                                                                                                                               There is, however, one major caveat: The subscription plan is only available through physical Microsoft Store locations, and not online or anywhere outside the United States. Bummer! Microsoft also characterizes the All Access program as a ""limited-time offer""; it sounds like the program is a test run for something bigger down the line.   That makes a lot of sense given Microsoft's ongoing push with Xbox — the company has been moving away from the traditional game console model, and it looks like the future of Xbox may be in software over consoles.   While the company is currently working on  at least one, if not several, new model of Xbox hardware, the overall philosophical approach of Microsoft's Xbox group has shifted toward enabling players to play games anywhere.   ""There are 2 billion people who play video games on the planet today. We're not gonna sell 2 billion consoles,"" Microsoft's Xbox lead, Phil Spencer, told Business Insider  in an interview in June. ""Many of those people don't own a television, many have never owned a PC. For many people on the planet, the phone is their compute device,"" he said. ""It's really about reaching a customer wherever they are, on the devices that they have.""                                              Microsoft                                      In the case of Xbox All Access, Microsoft is providing devices — the Xbox One S and Xbox One X consoles, both with 1TB of storage — at a far lower cost than the competition. More importantly, the pricing model offers consumer flexibility: People can upgrade their consoles easily.                                                                                                                                                                                               For example: Instead of feeling buyer's remorse on that new Xbox One S because you bought it right before the Xbox One X was announced, you could simply go to the more expensive plan and get your new console.   It's a smart move, and it may offer a look at a new way that companies like Microsoft and Sony can continually upgrade their game consoles while keeping them affordable for customers.

We've been there many times. We're here to make it easier to pick what shows you watch on Netflix this week.   We know what it's like to spend way too much time choosing what to watch, so every week we put together a list of three shows you can watch right now. We pick shows you can finish in a day, and some you can just get started on binge-watching. We mix shows that have recently come onto the service with some old favorites you might have missed. But they are all worth your time.   From Netflix's latest supernatural romance, ""The Innocents,"" to NBC's recently canceled (but delightful) newsroom comedy, ""Great News,"" here are three great shows you should watch this week.  Seasons: 1  Episodes: 8   This young adult supernatural thriller and love story is simple, but that's what makes it fun. It's easy to binge-watch, it's only eight episodes, and it won't take that much out of you.  Seasons: 4  Episodes: 40   Since there's a new slew of episodes coming to Netflix Friday, it's either time to revisit ""The Great British Baking Show"" or to catch up on the calming competition series right before everyone is talking about it again. This feel-good reality show will make you realize you don't actually know what baking is, and you'll never feel more emotion than when a contestant throws out his Baked Alaska.  Seasons: 1  Episodes: 10   ""Great News"" is a delightful show that mixes weird, escapist humor with biting commentary on the political climate and modern media. It fires snappy jokes as fast as its sister show, ""30 Rock,"" and for that it is incredibly re-watchable and will likely build up a devoted audience on Netflix.    ",0.011,0.817,0.172,0.9944

The plotline in question: Lara Jean's best friend, Chris, and her undying obsession with Subway sandwiches.   Chris is established as Lara Jean's rebellious (and only) friend on the pair's first day of 11th grade. Once lunchtime rolls around, however, Chris' secondary character trait comes into play: She really loves Subway.  Lara Jean receiving a text from Chris.                                            Netflix                                      In fact, Chris loves Subway so much she ditches Lara Jean to skip school and get sandwiches for lunch. Chris' dedication is so great that she even uses Subway-branded emoji.   When Chris and Lara Jean finally do have lunch together later in the film, it is only because Chris has brought back Subway for the pair to eat under the bleachers.   To feature a character with such an all-consuming love for Subway in ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" raised some eyebrows on social media.    To see exactly how Subway sandwiches ended up in the rom-com, Business Insider contacted the sandwich chain.   ""We regularly partner with production companies ... to place Subway in a range of films, especially ones we anticipate being popular,"" a Subway representative told Business Insider via email.                                                                                               Subway's history of inserting itself into TV shows and movies is well-documented. Over the past decade, Subway has made appearances on shows including ""The Biggest Loser,"" ""Nashville,"" and ""Community."" In 2013,  Variety reported that Subway distinguished itself not only by having sandwiches featured but also by pushing for products to be giving the equivalent of a ""speaking role,"" with storylines specifically mentioning the brand.   In the case of ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before,"" Subway gave the film's production companies permission to use the brand, with a local franchisee providing product and packaging. While the representative did not disclose details of the partnership, Subway certainly has the equivalent of a ""speaking role,"" with almost a third of Chris' screen time involving the chain.   The collaboration seems to be working. Numerous people — including  Business Insider's Carrie Wittmer— are reporting on social media that ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" left them with a surprising craving for a Subway sandwich.

But the genre has been dominating the TV landscape for years, with shows created by and starring women.   A staple in the film industry for decades, the romantic comedy slowly receded in the late 2000s and early 2010s.   Rom-coms were 1990s and 2000s culture, with at least one major release with a huge stars like Meg Ryan or Reese Witherspoon every few weeks. And that's because rom-coms were consistently solid at the box office. They were also wildly successful on DVD and cable, where many still play to this day — have you ever not stumbled upon a Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey movie on TBS?   But by 2010, rom-coms increasingly became less popular, both with critics and audiences. Since 2010, they went from nine major studio releases to zero in 2017. The last rom-com to earn  over $100 million domestically at the box office was 2015's ""Trainwreck."" Before that, the most prominent rom-com studio films were 2011's ""No Strings Attached"" and ""Friends With Benefits"": two rom-coms with literally the same premise.   But things have changed.   One of the most well-received movies of 2017 was indie rom-com ""The Big Sick,"" which got an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. And in 2018, chatter around the disappearance of the standard rom-com stirred around the release of Netflix's ""Set It Up,"" a conventional and predictable rom-com updated for a modern, young audience (the most iconic scene involves pizza, which feels right for the times). And the same week that ""Crazy Rich Asians"" came to theaters, Netflix released another rom-com starring an Asian-American actress: ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before.""   Netflix saw the need for original rom-coms after noticing that its users rewatched (over and over) romantic comedies like ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and ""The Wedding Planner"" that were available on the service.   But other TV networks were keeping the rom-com alive before Netflix started making these movies, and they paved the way for rom-coms with a modern twist. This started quietly and with judgment during TV's golden age, when the best shows on TV included ""Mad Men,"" ""Breaking Bad,"" and the early seasons of ""Game of Thrones.""   These new shows that incorporated rom-com elements, spanning from 2011 to today, gave fresh angles to the genre — from ""New Girl"" to ""The Mindy Project."" They opened up opportunities for darker rom-com movies including ""The Big Sick,"" as well as more formulaic, breezy ones like ""Set It Up.""   While a need and want for diversity in film is one of the reasons ""Crazy Rich Asians"" has been so successful, it's also the genre: after years of prestige dramas and superhero movies, people want to relax, laugh, and feel good about the future, and that's what rom-coms are doing, thanks to a generation of creators (mostly women) that were inspired by the iconic ones from the 90s.   People love rom-coms, but without these TV shows, they could have faded into obscurity as movie studios turned their backs. Or, if the genre did come back, they wouldn't be as modern and revolutionary: We'd still have a father character who, like the one in ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" aggressively pushes chastity on his daughters, rather than the dad in ""To All the Boys,"" who awkwardly hands his daughter a manila envelope filled with condoms.  From ""The Mindy Project"" to ""You're the Worst,"" here's all of the TV shows that were saving the romantic comedy on the small screen when the studios weren't making them for the big screen:  When ""New Girl"" premiered in 2011, it got a lukewarm reception. The feel-good, relentlessly charming, and positive comedy follows Jess Day (Zooey Deschanel), a bubbly and naive elementary school teacher who moves into a loft filled with men after she catches her boyfriend cheating on her.   As with many TV comedies, ""New Girl"" gained its momentum late into the first season as the show didn't have to rely on Deschanel. Jess Day was a worthy lead, but she was also the magnet keeping a great group of even quirkier characters together.   The show's rom-com feel relied on its ""will they/won't they"" relationship between Jess and Nick Miller (Jake Johnson). While this was certainly influenced by other TV romances like Ross and Rachel (""Friends"") and Sam and Diane (""Cheers""), the show was heavy on rom-com influences even though it wasn't trying. For example, it included silly side characters including an awkward musical-obsessed guy named Bearclaw (played by Josh Gad) and Sadie, a brutally honest lesbian OB/GYN played by June Diane Raphael. Rob Reiner, who directed movies including ""The Princess Bride"" and ""When Harry Met Sally â¦"" guest starred throughout the series as Jess Day's dad.   Mindy Kaling is one of the true saviors of the romantic comedy. Kaling is not shy about her obsession with movies like ""When Harry Met Sally ..."" And her show, ""The Mindy Project,"" which premiered on FOX in 2012, was very forward with its love of the genre. Movies like ""You've Got Mail"" are, after all, one of the reasons why Kaling went into the entertainment business.   ""The Mindy Project"" pilot's opening shot is a scene from ""When Harry Met Sally ..."" before there's any shot of any character in the series, followed by clips from ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Notting Hill.""    Over its six seasons, the series swapped characters and completely abandoned a lot of material in order to get better. But one thing stayed the same: Kaling's aggressive obsession with rom-coms.   Much like ""New Girl,"" which aired on the same network on the same night, ""The Mindy Project"" stuck with a ""will they/won't they"" relationship between Mindy Lahiri and Danny Castellano. And the show took a long, complicated journey to get to an ending that no 90-minute film could have accomplished.    ""You're the Worst"" is a cynic's take on the rom-com. And it reflects the dating habits of millennials. It's not about finding someone to marry: it's about avoiding that.   ""You're the Worst,"" which follows Gretchen and Jimmy, who meet at a wedding and have a one-night stand in the pilot, goes out of its way to demonstrate just how horrible its romantic leads are for each other. This is quite the opposite of what rom-coms do. And even if a rom-com tried to do this in film, it wouldn't have the time to invest as much as ""You're the Worst"" can with an episodic format.    ""You're the Worst"" has enough time to give its sloppiest (in personality, not writing) characters some depth and humanity, including Gretchen's best friend Lindsay, who is one of the dumbest people on the planet but also a human being with feelings and desires. It also has time for an entire season dedicated to Gretchen's clinical depression, and time to dive into Edgar's (Jimmy's roommate) heroin addiction and PTSD.    ""Jane the Virgin"" is influenced by a lot of things: telenovelas, romance novels, and romantic comedies.   The show, which follows Jane, a virgin who gets accidentally artificially inseminated with a man's sperm and chooses to have the baby and thus begins a love triangle with her current boyfriend and the father of the baby she's carrying, embraces cheesy romance because Jane does.   It can get heavy on drama, like an arc involving the death of a loved one and another involving breast cancer. The show also takes on other issues including illegal immigration, murder, and telenovela elements like a surprise twin sister. There's also quite a lot of kidnapping. But at its heart, it's a romantic comedy that focuses more on the romance than the comedy, which is what so many people really want, even if they don't admit it.   ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" takes a dangerous stereotype about women that romantic comedies have helped instill onto society (the ""crazy ex""), and uses it to tell a story of a woman with a mental illness that has a huge impact on her romantic relationships.   The show is deep, funny, and one of the most creative shows ever made on television. It doesn't get nearly enough credit for being hopelessly romantic while criticizing some of the bad things romantic comedies have depicted.   It also tells a lot of story, particularly inner workings of characters' minds through satirical songs that range from replicating the music of ""Les Miserables"" to Bruno Mars. There are usually two to three short songs per episode, depending on the length and production quality. One of its most iconic songs, ""The Math of Love Triangles""— inspired by Marilyn Monroe's ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" number from ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" — uses the dumb blonde stereotype to make fun of the overdone but captivating love triangle. Another popular song from the show's third season, ""Let's Generalize About Men,"" an 80s inspired anthem, is the four main female characters complaining about how awful men are in neon suits.    ""A to Z,"" which starred Ben Feldman (""Superstore,"" ""Mad Men"") and Cristin Milioti (the mother that ""How I Met Your Mother"" killed off) told the story of a long-winded romance. Andrew, a bro with a soft side, is obsessed with Zelda, who a ""girl's girl"" who ""likes pedicures and themed cocktail parties"" but avoids seriously dating someone at all costs. NBC canceled it a few weeks after it premiered.    ""Manhattan Love Story"" (2014) was a standard love story with a terrible twist: the audience got to know what the man and the woman were thinking. And guess what? It piled stereotype upon stereotype. The woman (Analeigh Tipton) loved shopping and purses, the man (Jake McDorman) loved sex and boobs. We'd already seen this premise in ""What Women Want,"" and it didn't work there either. ABC canceled it less than a month after its premiere.   But even though these shows failed spectacularly, they also helped people (a generation of creators in particular) realize that this genre works within television. And this eventually got romantic comedies where they are today: revolutionized for a new era of viewers who never wanted them to go away. They just wanted something new.   ",0.098,0.729,0.173,0.9992

Netflix                                       That was basically the proposal put forward this week by Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's opposition party and Prime Minister Theresa May's most powerful adversary.   Speaking to an audience of some of the UK's most influential media executives, Corbyn posited the idea of creating a British Digital Corporation, or BDC. If that acronym has a familiar ring, you'd be right.   Under his vision, the BDC would effectively be a sister organisation to the BBC, a sort of digital sidekick to Britain's 96-year-old national broadcaster, known affectionately as Auntie.   Like the BBC, the BDC would be funded and owned by the British public. The BBC collects its money through the TV licence, a levy on UK households that generates around Â£3.8 billion ($4.9 billion) in revenue a year for the corporation.   Corbyn was a little woolly on the detail, and his suggestions prompted people to speculate that he wants to create a nationalised Facebook, without all the nasty fake news and data misuse, where users can vote on TV shows they want to be made.   Below is the plan in his own words, taken from his speech at the Edinburgh International Television Festival in Scotland. You can watch the speech in full here. Corbyn said:   ""A BDC could use all of our best minds, the latest technology and our existing public assets not only to deliver information and entertainment to rival Netflix and Amazon but also to harness data for the public good.   ""A BDC could develop new technology for online decision making and audience-led commissioning of programmes and even a public social media platform with real privacy and public control over the data that is making Facebook and others so rich.                                                                                               ""It could become the access point for public knowledge, information and content currently held in the BBC archives, the British Library and the British Museum. Imagine an expanded iPlayer giving universal access to licence fee payers for a product that could rival Netflix and Amazon. It would probably sell pretty well overseas as well.""   Delegates who spoke to Business Insider after the speech concluded it was a radical, but ultimately unworkable and unnecessary plan. Others just ridiculed it.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.                                            Getty                                      Brent Hoberman, the founder of lastminute.com and a prominent UK tech investor, tweeted: ""Who is advising these people?!!?""  Damian Collins, the Conservative politician in charge of the committee of lawmakers that held Facebook to account over the Cambridge Analytica crisis, was equally scathing. He said it would be a ""British Digital Leyland""— a reference to British Leyland, which in 1968 amalgamated several carmakers into one company in one of the biggest disasters in the history of nationalisation.                                                                                               Alison Kirkham, a senior figure at the BBC, raised an even more existential question about Corbyn's vision. She told me that the British Digital Corporation overlooks an organisation already doing the very things he wants to achieve — the BBC.   Don't forget, the BBC basically invented the online video player with iPlayer in 2007. Indeed, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once said: ""The iPlayer really blazed the trail. That was long before Netflix and really got people used to this idea of on-demand viewing.""   And as far as creating social conversation, connecting people, audience-led commissioning, and broadening horizons, are concerned, well the BBC has been doing that since it was invented in 1922.   Just look at radio phone-ins, giant shared viewing experiences like ""Strictly Come Dancing"" (or ""Dancing With the Stars"" as it is known in the US), TV shows being axed or supercharged based on ratings, and the BBC's partnerships with organisations like The Open University. All of which can be accessed online.   ""There seems to be a lack of understanding that the BBC is already a very digital organisation,"" Kirkham, the BBC's controller of factual commissioning said.                                                                                               ""It's a real asset that the digital offer is an integral part of the broader BBC offer. I'm not sure it would serve audiences, I'm not sure it would make economic sense, to peel the two away and create two separate organisations.""   Corbyn certainly achieved his aim of getting people talking to ""generate some new thinking."" Like all radical ideas, however, it appears to have raised more questions than answers.

Netflix sank as much as 14% last month following the streaming giant's second-quarter earnings report which showed it had added far fewer subscribers than Wall Street was expecting. Shares have rebounded a bit, but remain well off their $423 high set earlier this summer. And while then fundamentals remain enough for SunTrust to upgrade the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold,"" Thornton has lowered his price target  to $410 from $415 — a 17% premium to where the stock was set to open Friday. Buying the dip is a strategy that has become wildly popular over the course of the 9-1/2-year bull market in which equities have nearly constantly risen.

So we're here to make it easier for you.   Every week, we look through what's available on the streaming service and recommend seven movies you can watch over the weekend. Some of our selections recently came to Netflix and some have been available for a while. You might have just missed them because Netflix's algorithm didn't know you as well as it thought it did.   From ""Batman Begins"" to ""Wet Hot American Summer"" — the movie, not the series — these are some awesome movies on Netflix you can watch this weekend.  Here are seven movies on Netflix you should check out (along with their scores from Rotten Tomatoes). Note: Not all of these films are available in countries outside the United States. Apologies! Netflix description: Following the murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne trains with a shadowy organization and returns to Gotham City to fight crime under a new guise.  Critic score: 84%  Audience score: 94%   Remember when Katie Holmes was in a ""Batman"" movie? Cherish the memories with ""Batman Begins,"" a dark and brooding origin story that will remind you once again that Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered and that Liam Neeson is an amazing villain.  Netflix description: Kate, an uptight chef, finds her life turned upside down when her sister dies in a car accident and she becomes her niece's sole guardian.  Critic score: 42%  Audience score: 62%   This rom-com initially received bad reviews for its dark tone and predictability. But Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Abigail Breslin make it worth your time.  Netflix description: Held captive in an enchanted castle where clocks and candlesticks come to life, a brave young woman clashes with a beastly but good-hearted prince.  Critic score: 71%  Audience score: 81%   This movie is a bit of a mess — except for Ewan McGregor as the voice of LumiÃ¨re the candlestick and its stunning visuals. But it takes a solid story and adds a few elements that make it better, including a meatier story for Gaston and LeFou.  Netflix description: After learning that his ex-girlfriend had an experimental medical procedure to purge all memories of him, a man decides to do the same with her.  Critic score: 93%  Audience score: 94%   ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a weird, sad, and fascinating romantic comedy that is also one of the greatest achievements in cinema. Its story is like no other seen before it (or after). And the performances from Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey are stunning. This movie certainly inspired a generation of quirky filmmakers to tell dark love stories, and for that alone it's worth revisiting.  Netflix description: Justin Quayle, a member of the British High Commission based in Africa, begins his own international investigation when his wife is murdered.  Critic score: 83%  Audience score: 82%   Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz do some of their best work to date in this gripping thriller that will keep you guessing and guessing. It's a grossly underrated movie that gets almost everything right, from performances to direction to unfolding an intricate mystery.  Netflix description: Everyone wants a final shot at action on the last day at Camp Firewood, in this campy 1980s summer-camp spoof from the creators of ""The State.""  Critic score: 33%  Audience score: 76%   Summer is finally wrapping up, and it's been a hot one. So enjoy one of the last weekends of summer 2018 inside with your air conditioning and ""Wet Hot American Summer,"" one of the strangest but most brilliant teen-movie satires ever made. And even if you've watched it fairly recently, watch it again — it's very rewatchable.  Netflix description: When perennially single Bridget finds herself pregnant at age 43, she has to figure out if she's ready for motherhood — and who the baby's father is.  Critic score: 77%  Audience score: 65%   This movie, released years after that last ""Bridget Jones"" movie, came and went a bit quietly. But it's just as good as the others, with excellent performances from Colin Firth (has he ever done something bad?) and even Patrick Dempsey, who basically got himself killed off on ""Grey's Anatomy"" for this.

Comedy Dynamics                                      Jim Gaffigan's latest stand-up special, ""Noble Ape,"" features some of the strongest material of the comedian's career. In part, he recounts with moving and dark humor the plight of his wife and cowriter, Jeannie Gaffigan, who last year underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor.   But Gaffigan's unorthodox distribution of ""Noble Ape"" is nearly as notable as the comedy it contains.   With five of his stand-up specials already on Netflix, Gaffigan opted to follow the suggestion of his longtime producer, Comedy Dynamics founder Brian Volk-Weiss, who proposed that Gaffigan release his sixth special simultaneously for purchase and renting on a wide variety of services like Apple TV, Amazon, Spotify, and numerous other on-demand outlets.   In July, the expansive release ran through the distribution arm of Volk-Weiss's company, which also gave the special a limited theatrical run.   In a phone interview with Business Insider, Gaffigan discussed the distribution of ""Noble Ape"" and the process of working on its ""cathartic"" material with his wife (who directed the special), as well his experiences of touring the world for his act.  John Lynch: Could you take me through how you landed on the distribution model for this special? Jim Gaffigan: Every special that I've released, I've looked at what was the best opportunity to get that special viewed or listened to by as many people as possible. For my first special, ""Beyond the Pale,"" Comedy Central was the perfect destination for it. That was a time before streaming, at the peak of Comedy Central, so ""Beyond the Pale"" and ""King Baby"" were perfect for that. Comedy Central was on in every dorm room. By the time I got to ""Mr. Universe"" and ""Obsessed,"" I looked at what the best opportunity was, and with those, one was released on my website, when that was a thing that people were actively participating in. Then I got to the point with ""Cinco"" where it was sold directly to Netflix. Now, Netflix also ended up purchasing the rights to my specials to stream on their service.   When I had ""Noble Ape,"" I was like, ""All right, I have five specials on Netflix."" I had received offers from the usual suspects, and I was approached by Comedy Dynamics, proposing that the special would be available everywhere people rent or buy. So I wasn't sure exactly how that was going to work, but they explained that people consume things in a different manner. Some people consume things on-demand. Some people watch it on Amazon Prime. Some people watch it on Apple TV. Some people listen to it on Spotify. So their model — you know, obviously they offered me good money — but their model made it available to everyone. You didn't just have to have Netflix. And I thought this was appealing, that it'd be available to everyone at the same time.  Lynch: Several weeks out from the release now, how are you gauging the success of it? Gaffigan: From what I'm hearing from Comedy Dynamics, it's doing amazing. The way the distribution is set up, they gave me a lump sum, and after that we split the profits. But I more measure the success of it on people gaining access to it. I mean, this is a very personal special. It's discussing my wife's brain tumor and all of that. I would say that it's been great, but it's weird, you know, how the landscape changes all the time. From feedback on social media, it's gangbusters. Do you know what I mean? I've never used that term before.  Lynch: (laughs) Yeah. You know, I saw it at the Village East theater here in Manhattan. Given that it was in select theaters, I imagine that wasn't a huge overall factor in the release. But was it at all important to you to have it in theaters, or how did you think of that aspect of it? Gaffigan: That was something that Comedy Dynamics pursued. It was not something I had an expectation of. With previous specials, when you're kind of approached with options, that's one scenario. Comedians have released specials in theaters. But I was thrilled about the theatrical release, even though it was small, just because it was a further example of it being everywhere you watch and rent.   Lynch: Seeing it in theaters, you do open with this very cinematic, BuÃ±uel-esque surrealist scene, depicting the horrors of brain surgery but also the dark comedy of that situation. How was it for your wife to direct that opening and the special itself? Gaffigan: You know, it's interesting. That whole opening was my wife's idea. It was something that she wanted to do. The timing of us shooting it, because I was working on a couple movies, made it so that it was only available in the theatrical release, and I think it's been added as an extra feature on iTunes. But that was all Jeannie's idea. Obviously, my wife and I, we write everything together. She was instrumental in some of the material on her brain tumor, but that opening was all her. It was interesting, and my five-year-old, he was like, ""It's too scary."" The opening's too scary for him.  Lynch: What was your experience generally of incorporating this really personal material with some of the more traditional stuff that you do? How was it working with the mix of that? Gaffigan: Look, as a comedian, it's incredibly cathartic to process life events into material. It kind of helps organize them, and it pays homage to the feelings or fears you might have been experiencing. But I also think that's how I process life is through jokes, and same with my wife. My wife came out of a two-hour MRI, and she was like, ""Write this down,"" like she had ideas from the MRI. It just kind of happens in certain ways.  Lynch: In the second half of the special, you sort of take us on a tour describing your touring abroad. You joke about difficulties with social mores in China, Japan, England. I'm wondering, is there any country or area in the world that you've found harder to perform in than others? Gaffigan: Well, some of doing stand-up in other countries is — it's not ideal, but that's almost what I enjoy about it. First of all, you're subjected to a completely different set of social norms, and you typically have a language difference. But those obstacles, they provide fodder for material. I did a show in Barcelona, and I only got to spend a day or two in Barcelona, but it prompts you to absorb. And some of it may be initial observation. I'm sorry, I don't know if I'm even answering your question.                                                                                                                                  Lynch: (laughs) No yeah, it's all good. Gaffigan: But yeah, I love the international shows because I'm somebody who loves traveling internationally, and I love different cultures. You're forced to have a completely different point-of-view, and it also gives you insight into your own culture. You know, Paris is a beautiful city, but I think famous writers have written in Paris because they can gain a perspective on America just by being in another country.  Lynch: How would you say your years of touring informed this special in particular? Gaffigan: I would say, doing stand-up for as long as I have, you develop a skill set. Any comedian would tell you you should be able to make everything funny, and doing stand-up for that long, whether it be a medical crisis or traveling through another country, those same skills that I use to make food or laziness funny, I can apply those same skills to what it's like to be an American in another country or what it's like to have a spouse have this life-threatening medical emergency.   Lynch: Going back to the distribution briefly, the path you took for ""Noble Ape,"" do you see that as a viable option for other comedians, or as something you'll see people adopt? Gaffigan: What I've learned from doing stand-up and releasing six specials now is that the landscape changes relatively dramatically every couple years. There was a time when having a special Comedy Central seemed like the only logical step to take, or releasing a special on Netflix seemed like the only logical step. But the marketplace is ever-changing. By the way, Netflix is great for stand-up. I love Netflix. Netflix has five specials of mine. If I didn't have five specials on Netflix, I might have taken a different approach. But every couple years, the technology and market changes. When I started stand-up, there was no YouTube. Comedy Central was just like a clumsy cable network that did comedy. I mean, I'm thrilled that people are enjoying this special, and I'm thrilled that Comedy Dynamics views the special as a success. Comedian friends have expressed excitement that there's an alternative in distribution, but I also know that we live in an age where, in a year, Amazon, or Apple, or who knows, Disney, could get into the comedy business, because comedy specials are relatively inexpensive to produce.   What I've found with my material, and one of the things that was also appealing, is an audio version being released simultaneously, because a lot of people consume my comedy while driving in a car. Some distribution models, understandably, they want it exclusively to say, HBO, or Showtime, or Netflix. They don't want the audio version released right away. But in ten or fifteen years, with the audio version of a stand-up special as an album, I think people kind of underestimate the popularity of that, because we're living in this age where audio streaming services are really rising out of nowhere.  Lynch: Moving forward for you, what's next? I know you've also been in a couple films this year, but what's on deck for you career-wise? Gaffigan: I love acting, and given the right opportunity, I would love to do tons of acting in film. But the thing that's great about stand-up is you don't have to wait for the opportunity. You can be writing and working whenever you want. Obviously, living in New York City, it's helpful to be able to walk over to a club and try out material. I love acting and I love stand-up, but no matter what I do, I'll always be doing stand-up. Creating specials is something that I really enjoy.  ""Noble Ape"" is available now on on-demand services like Apple TV, Amazon, iTunes, and more.  ",0.033,0.764,0.203,0.9999

George Clooney  came in first despite not having been in a movie, thanks to the $700 million sale of his company Casamigos Tequila.   But two of the other entries were powered by significant paychecks from Netflix. Adam Sandler came in at No. 8 with $39.5 million, a large chunk of which came from his sprawling movie deal with Netflix. Sandler originally signed a four-movie deal with Netflix in 2014, which was extended for another four films in 2017.   Sandler's Netflix films have been universally trashed by critics. His first movie for Netflix, 2015's ""The Ridiculous 6,"" has a stunning 0% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. 2016's ""The Do-Over"" has only a slightly better 5%. None of his Netflix movies so far have gotten over a 30% Rotten Tomatoes score from critics.   But Netflix's execs love Sandler, praising how his comedy travels around the world and the high viewership of the movies he's made with the company. And people must be watching otherwise the streaming giant would never have extended his deal for another four movies last year.   Netflix has used the examples of Sandler and Smith as a sign that critics are out of touch.   Netflix's fantasy cop movie ""Bright,"" starring Smith, was its first foray into a true blockbuster. The movie  reportedly cost $90 million to make, $20 million of which went to Smith, which helped him into the No. 6 spots on Forbes' list at $42 million overall.   Critics tore the movie apart, giving it a 26% on Rotten Tomatoes, but audiences were more favorable. The movie's audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes sits at 84% and had  11 million viewers its opening weekend on the service, according to Nielsen.   Earlier this year, Netflix's programming boss Ted Sarandos referenced the disconnect between the critic and audience reaction.                                                                                               ""Critics are an important part of the artistic process but are pretty disconnected from the commercial prospects of a film,""  Sarandos said.

The BBC is currently funded to the tune of Â£3.8 billion ($4.9 billion) by the licence fee, paid by TV-owning British households. Corbyn's plan is to supplement this with what he will call a ""digital licence fee.""   ""In the digital age, we should consider whether a digital licence fee could be a fairer and more effective way to fund the BBC,"" he will tell an audience of the UK's most senior TV and media executives.   ""A digital licence fee, supplementing the existing licence fee, collected from tech giants and Internet Service Providers, who extract huge wealth from our shared digital space, could allow a democratized and more plural BBC to compete far more effectively with the private multinational digital giants like Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook.""

Tech firms and ISPs are unlikely to welcome what would effectively be a tax on their operations in the UK.   Indeed Tech UK, a trade body that represents tech firms in the UK and counts the likes of Apple and Google among its members, immediately trashed the idea. ""It is good to see Mr. Corbyn engaging on these issues, however we need better ideas than just another proposal to tax tech companies,"" it said in a statement.   It's unclear whether the BBC would even welcome such a move, which could be seen as a threat to its independence. And then there's the fact that Corbyn's party is not in power, and that the BBC's funding arrangements and operating agreement, or charter, is set in stone until 2027.                                                                                                                       What is clear, however, is that the BBC regularly complains of being under threat from firms like Apple and Netflix. In a speech in February, BBC Director General Tony Hall said the ""Fang"" companies — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — are doing a smash and grab job on the UK television industry and will ""skilfully mine every ounce of personal data to drive growth and profit.""   Corbyn will say that ""we need bold, radical thinking on the future of our media"" because trust is waning and control is being concentrated in the hands of a ""few tech giants and unaccountable billionaires.""

Digital publishers' ""pivot to video"" is now going to longer form content. In recent years, publishers have been increasing their focus on short-form clips designed for social media. But distributing short-form clips on news feeds has contributed only limited revenues for digital publishers, despite offering massive reach.   In search of better deals, publishers have sought production deals to make higher quality, longer form video in partnership with streaming video platforms or TV networks. These deals can deliver higher engagement, fan loyalty, and brand-building clout.   Going forward, Mic plans to produce more long-form shows for subscription video on demand (SVOD) platforms and TV networks: In addition to its Facebook Watch deal, Mic is also coproducing a documentary for Hulu about the disastrous Fyre Festival, and is in talks with Amazon and Netflix.   This strategy is in line with similar pushes at Vox Entertainment, which has landed shows on CNN, FYI, Netflix, and PBS; CondÃ© Nast Entertainment, which has six Netflix shows; Fusion Media Group, which has coproduced five Netflix series; and Vice Media, with long-running ""Vice News"" on HBO.

The official James Bond Twitter account announced on Tuesday that Boyle — the Oscar-winning filmmaker behind ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""Steve Jobs,"" ""28 Days Later,"" and more — exited the untitled 25th Bond film over ""creative differences.""  The movie is scheduled for a November 2019 release date and was supposed to start production later this year, which means a replacement director will probably be announced soon if it wants to meet the release date.   Of those 11 Bond directors, none have been a woman or person of color, so with Boyle gone, it feels like a good time to consider the likes of Steve McQueen, Kathryn Bigelow, and more.   But no matter who replaces Boyle, they'll most likely be directing star Daniel Craig in his last Bond film after he reluctantly came back for his fifth outing as the character. The pressure's on.  Below are 10 filmmakers who should direct the next James Bond movie: Films include: ""The Hurt Locker,"" ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""Detroit""   If MGM is looking for Oscar-winning filmmakers to take over the Bond franchise, then it should set its sights on Bigelow, the only woman to ever win the best directing Oscar for the 2009 film ""The Hurt Locker."" Bigelow is an expert in crafting tension, as seen in her films of real-life high stakes like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Detroit.""  Films include: ""Crazy Heart,"" ""Out of the Furnace,"" ""Black Mass,"" ""Hostiles""   Cooper's ""Hostiles,"" about a 19th century Army captain who reluctantly escorts a Native American family back to their tribal land, was his best film to date. It was criminally overlooked in the 2017-2018 awards circle, but proved he's ready to take on something bigger like Bond. (It's also on Netflix in the US.)  Films include: ""Winter's Bone,"" ""Leave No Trace""   Granik went eight years without releasing a feature film between this year's ""Leave No Trace"" and 2010's ""Winter's Bone,"" which earned a best picture Oscar nomination and Jennifer Lawrence her first best actress nomination. But she didn't lose her edge with ""Leave No Trace"" and would be a worthy replacement for Boyle on Bond.  Films include: ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints,"" ""Pete's Dragon,"" ""A Ghost Story""   Lowery isn't known for ""action movies"" in the slightest. He was an unlikely choice for a live-action take on Disney's ""Pete's Dragon,"" and would also be an unlikely choice for a Bond film, the most unlikely on this list. But the same could have been said of Sam Mendes before he delivered with ""Skyfall.""  Films include: ""Hell or High Water,"" ""Outlaw King""   It remains to be seen how Mackenzie's ""Outlaw King"" will be received when it arrives on Netflix later this year, but his ""Hell or High Water"" was one of the best films of 2016, and showed he knows how to balance drama with heart-beating action.  Films include: ""Walk the Line,"" ""3:10 to Yuma,"" ""The Wolverine,"" ""Logan""   Mangold was reported to be helming a Boba Fett standalone ""Star Wars"" movie, but details on that are scarce and Disney's plans for ""Star Wars"" spinoffs after ""Solo"" disappointed are up in the air. So if Mangold is free, he'd be perfect for Bond.  Films include: ""Jack Reacher,"" ""Mission: Impossible — Ghost Nation,"" ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout""   The most obvious choice on this list, McQuarrie has delivered two of the best ""Mission: Impossible"" movies, and this year's ""Fallout"" is being called the best action movie in years. According to Variety's Justin Kroll, rumors of McQuarrie replacing Boyle immediately started to swirl once Boyle exited, but that can be taken with a grain of salt.  Films include: ""Shame,"" ""12 Years a Slave,"" ""Widows""   McQueen's ""Widows,"" which comes to theaters in November, looks like a tense thriller that makes you wonder what a Bond film would be like in his hands.  Films include: ""We Need to Talk About Kevin,"" ""You Were Never Really Here""   Ramsay's ""You Were Never Really Here"" garnered widespread critical praise earlier this year. Joaquin Phoenix plays a veteran who uncovers a conspiracy while tracking down a missing girl.  Films include: ""Wind River""   Sheridan wrote the screenplay for ""Hell or High Water"" and directed last year's ""Wind River."" With ""Wind River,"" he crafted a dramatic thriller/murder mystery that showed he has what it takes for Bond.   ",0.106,0.768,0.125,0.9755

In a way, it’s one of the final chapters inÂ the longer saga of Orson Welles â who, after making “Citizen Kane” (often cited as the greatest film of all time) and “The Magnificent Ambersons,” spent most of the ensuing decades in Europe, piecing together the funding for projects like “Chimes at Midnight.” He shot “The Other Side of the Wind” throughout the 1970s and even managed to edit part of the film before running out of funding. Since his death in 1985, Peter Bogdanovich and other Welles supporters have tried to complete the film, but they’ve been stymied by additional legal and financial issues. Until recently, that is, when Netflix stepped in to fund the work. The streaming giant’s involvement did cause some additional issues, namely its absence from the Cannes Film Festival (the festival passed a rule last year that effectively blocks Netflix films from participating), but the movie is set to screen this fall at the Venice and New York film festivals, then launch on Netflix  on November 2. As further proof that this really is happening, Netflix has released the first trailer. While the trailer is a bit cryptic, it gives us a good look at Jack Hannaford, the reactionary director at the center of the film â he’s played by John Huston, the legendary director and occasional actor who also portrayed the villain in “Chinatown.”",0.045,0.832,0.123,0.9643

The patient, now 6, began suffering brief spells of slowing and drooping around the time she turned 1.
 Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries. By LISA SANDERS, M.D. AUG. 23, 2018 This is the sixth of the 10 patients I will present here in The New York Times Magazine as part of our collaboration with Netflix, seeking your help. Usually I ask for assistance in making a diagnosis, but this time we are asking for something a little different. Below is the story of a little girl named Kamiyah. She’s 6 years old now. But around the time she turned 1, she began to have strange spells, which can be seen in the video below. As I explain in the story, she now has a diagnosis. But she is the first child to receive a diagnosis of this genetic abnormality from the National Institutes of Health’s Undiagnosed Diseases Network. We are looking for others with the same kind of spells. If you recognize Kamiyah’s symptoms — if you have seen this in someone you know or if this child reminds you of a patient you haven’t been able to find a diagnosis for — please let us know. The toddler zipped across the room on her hands and knees. She had only recently started crawling and clearly loved the sense of speed and independence that her newfound mobility gave her. Go, baby, go, her mother called out encouragingly. Suddenly the child stopped; her head dipped toward the floor. Her arms bent, lowering her upper body to the floor. Kamiyah? Her mother called out. Baby? She hurried toward where her daughter knelt, head on the floor, eyes closed. But before she got there, the child’s eyes popped open; she lifted her head, straightened her arms and immediately raced across the floor, as if nothing had happened. What was that? the young mother asked her husband. Is that normal? The baby, their first, now seemed fine. Maybe it was O.K., the father suggested. Then it happened again, and again. A total of 10, maybe 20 times in the hours she played on the floor. The mother had never seen anything like it before. Neither had the father. Maybe this was just something that babies did? She had an appointment with her pediatrician in Sioux Falls, S.D., in a couple of weeks. She could ask him then. After that day, the little girl’s mother began to see the strange spells all the time. Sometimes it was so quick that it was almost as if she imagined it. Her beautiful daughter’s eyes would flutter shut, and she would seem to be asleep — but just for a second or two. Then her eyes would open and she would be back in the room, back with them, as if she had never been away. Was is something that just started? Or was it that they had never really noticed it until she was moving. The baby had some developmental delay — they had been told that — but was this part of whatever it was that caused her delay? The strangest part of these little spells was that she was most likely to have them when she was happy. That first time, the delight in her own speed had been so clear on the little girl’s face. Other times, she would be smiling, even laughing, when suddenly she would draw her arms close to her body stiffly. Then she would blink, once, twice, and her eyes would close. Sometimes you could hear her breathing change, becoming raspy and slowed, before she drew her arms in and her eyelids fell. If she was sitting up, her head would drift forward until her chin was resting on her chest. And then her torso would take up the movement, sinking forward, almost in slow motion. Sometimes her mother would catch her before her forehead made contact with the floor, but often enough before she even got close, the child would wake up and sit back up as if the past 10 to 15 seconds had never happened.

The doctor, a young-looking guy with an eager smile, listened as she described Kamiyah’s strange episodes. It looked as if she was a little dizzy, the mom suggested, as if she were putting her head down to let the dizzy spell pass. The doctor thought a moment. Maybe she has an earache, he offered. He looked in her ears. She’d had several ear infections that spring. And, sure enough, though the ear canal wasn’t red, he could see fluid behind the ear drum. He prescribed a few days of ear drops. That should take care of it, he said. Mom was hopeful, but the medication didn’t make a difference. Kamiyah had dozens of these little spells every day, before, during and after she took the medication. ↓ If they didn’t improve when the infection was treated, maybe these were seizures, the doctor suggested when mother and child returned. Did she seem a little slow after these little spells, as if she was confused? Not even a little, the mom insisted. She just kept doing whatever she was doing before the blanked-out episode. There was no change at all. And now that she was crawling, these spells weren’t just odd, they were terrifying. They happened dozens, sometimes hundreds, of times a day. They had carpeted all the floors she normally moved on, but how in the world could they protect her once she started to walk? The pediatrician sent Kamiyah for an EEG and referred them to a pediatric neurologist. (You can see the notes from those first two visits here. ) When the day of the appointment with the neurologist finally came, the child’s mother brought all Kamiyah’s favorite toys. She knew that if she could make her laugh, she would trigger one of these spells and the doctor could see what was happening. The neurologist did see. It looked to her like an absence seizure, a type of epilepsy usually seen in children and characterized by brief episodes of a loss of awareness, without a loss of consciousness. She ordered an EEG to look for seizure activity. It was completely normal. Thinking that they had missed the episodes, she ordered a longer EEG and then a video EEG. None showed any seizure activity in the brain. A CT scan was also normal. Despite the normal EEGs, the neurologist continued to think that what she was seeing in her office and on the videos were most likely some type of seizure. She prescribed an anti-seizure medication called Keppra, but Kamiyah’s parents weren’t ready to drug their child. Instead they sought a second opinion from a pediatric neurosurgeon in nearby Omaha. That doctor agreed with the first neurologist: Despite the normal EEG, it was still possible that these were seizures. They would get an M.R.I., but if it was normal, she still should try the medication. (You can see the letter from the second neurologist here, along with the M.R.I. report.) ↓ They started the little girl on Keppra. Nothing. The seizures kept coming, and the medicine made the child sleepy. They tried a second drug, which seemed to make the spells a little less frequent, but she still had them. What about sending her to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., the first neurologist suggested. They would try anything, the parents told him. So when Kamiyah was 2 years old, she and her mother went to the Mayo Clinic. The pediatric neurologist there saw several of Kamiyah’s spells. Her first thought was also that these were some sort of seizures, and she ordered still another EEG with video monitoring. Other possibilities on her list was some sort of movement disorder — either a type of dystonia, a transient stiffening of the muscles, or dyskinesia, a loss of voluntary muscle control. Help Dr. Lisa Sanders find patients with similar symptoms.Click here to submit a case like this.   When Kamiyah’s mother revealed that Kamiyah’s grandmother has narcolepsy, the possibility that the child had inherited that disorder was raised. Narcolepsy is a rare disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness and can induce something called a sleep attack, where sleep can come on suddenly, often at inappropriate times. In addition, most of those with narcolepsy experience something known as cataplexy — sudden transient muscle weakness episodes often caused by strong, usually positive, emotions. The fact that Kamiyah had most of her episodes of weakness when she was happy was suggestive of cataplexy. But her mother dismissed the questions of daytime sleepiness — she was a very active child — and the sleep studies weren’t consistent with a diagnosis of narcolepsy. None of the other tests were revealing either, so Kamiyah and her mother left the Mayo Clinic the same way they had come, without a diagnosis. (You can see the admission note and sleep doctor note here.) ↓ The following year, Kamiyah’s neurologist suggested that the child be referred to the National Institutes of Health’s Undiagnosed Diseases Network. This is a program developed by three branches of the N.I.H. — the National Human Genome Research Institute, the Genetic and Rare Diseases office of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and the N.I.H. Clinical Center — to help provide a diagnosis for patients with mysterious symptoms who have remained without one even after a thorough evaluation. The application process is rigorous, requiring medical records from all the physicians who have seen the patient and results of all the studies done. Even so, the program accepts only a fraction of those who apply. Kamiyah’s mother recognized the challenge. She described for me her understanding of what the N.I.H. was looking for: “You had to be sick enough to go, rare enough to be appealing and well enough to not die before you got there. That’s a hard boat to rock. We’re really, really sick, but we’re not dying. Please take us.” They sent in their application, and then they waited. The response took months, but finally the letter came that said that Kamiyah was one of the few, one of the chosen. And so, in January 2016, she and her mother traveled to Bethesda, Md., for an evaluation at what Kamiyah’s mother knew was the diagnostic center of last resort — the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.   When mother and child arrived at the N.I.H., they were given a schedule of the dozens of tests to be performed and specialists Kamiyah would see over the next five days. She would be evaluated by a team including a neurologist, a dermatologist, an ophthalmologist, an immunologist and a specialist in rehabilitation medicine. She would have studies done on just about every part of her body — her skin, her heart, her blood, her brain. At the end of the five days, the child and her mother met with the team so that the available results could be explained. The experts still didn’t have a diagnosis, but they were hopeful. It could be that the child actually did have some kind of seizure disorder, one that couldn’t be picked up on EEG. They were also testing the child again for narcolepsy. And finally, it was possible that genetic testing might reveal the cause of these strange spells. But, they reminded Kamiyah’s mother, most of those who came to the U.D.N. did not get a diagnosis. ↓ At the end of the meeting, Kamiyah’s mom told me, they told her that the work they did to try to make a diagnosis took time but that they would be in touch with her. They told her that it could be months before they had an answer — if they had an answer. “It was like: ‘We’re sorry. We don’t have any answers right now. Hopefully we’ll call you in six months or, you know, 10 years,’” she told me, laughing. “And off we went on our merry way.” But then she added: “At that point, I knew that I had done absolutely 100 percent everything humanly possible. I had now gone to the end of the Earth.” As a patient at the U.D.N., she said, they tell you that “you’re offering what you have in hopes of helping somebody else in the future. That was a really tough pill to swallow, because let’s be honest, I’m a selfish mom. I want them to save my kid, too.” (You can see the admission and discharge notes from the N.I.H. here.) And so mother and child returned to South Dakota, hopeful, but trying to remain realistic. Kamiyah’s mother waited, and waited, for an answer, but none came. She had practically given up when she finally heard from the U.D.N. just six weeks ago. The email said they had an answer for Kamiyah, now 6 years old. The whole team wanted to be there to discuss the results. When would she be available the following week? The young mother almost exploded. When she recovered herself, she emailed back, How about now? I mean, I’ve waited more than two years, and you call me with an answer that I have to wait another week for? The team couldn’t get together before then, the reply said. It was one of the longest weeks of her life. ↓ Finally, the call came. It was good to hear the voices of the doctors she and Kamiyah had gotten to know during their trip to Bethesda. Dr. Cynthia Tifft, the pediatric geneticist who led the team, broke the news. Kamiyah had a genetic defect that was causing these strange spells. It was not something she inherited from either of her parents but was what is called a de novo, or new, mutation. This particular mutation caused a slowdown of one of the mechanisms controlling activity in the brain and spinal cord, and that, in turn, caused her episodes of slowing down, or what the U.D.N. team called paroxysmal dyskinesia. There are a number of types of paroxysmal dyskinesia, triggered by a variety of problems. Although many of those with this kind of rare disorder experienced unexpected movement, Kamiyah’s mutation actually causes a suppression of movement leading to her transient episodes of weakness. And while Kamiyah was the first to receive this diagnosis at the U.D.N., a handful of patients around the world were known to have the same abnormality. Most of these young people had, in additional to the paroxysmal dyskinesia, some combination of seizure disorder, intellectual disability or developmental delay. So Kamiyah was something of an outlier, even here. They were certain that Kamiyah did not have a seizure disorder or intellectual disability, and Tifft thought that much, perhaps all of Kamiyah’s very mild developmental delay was caused by these frequent episodes of dyskinesia, which stole developmental time from her. Treating these episodes — probably with some type of anti-seizure medication — so that they became less frequent, could allow Kamiyah to catch up to her normal developmental age. She doesn’t have epileptiform seizures, but those medicines can affect brain activity, and that’s what she needs — a medication that can affect her brain in a way that lets it work more normally. Which seizure medication? Kamiyah’s mother wanted to know. The answer was, We can’t tell you. While science is still learning about how this gene works — knowledge that may someday help doctors choose the best type of medicine for Kamiyah — it still isn’t clear which medicine or combination of medicines will be most effective. You’ll have to work with a neurologist to figure that out. The mother had heard that Gillette Hospital in Minneapolis had expertise in dealing with children with complex medical problems. Would they refer Kamiyah there? They would. And then the call was over. And mother and child were left to try to understand what this new information might mean for Kamiyah. Kamiyah’s mother has hope, and a few ideas. “Maybe we’re not the only ones,” she started. “What if there’s something somewhere that somebody tried that I haven’t found? Because I am only one person, and as far as I reach and as hard as I try, it takes a village to raise a kid. Now, I’m looking for that village.” And that’s where you may be able to help. There have been 21 patients with this exact genetic abnormality published in the scientific literature. But there are probably many more than that here in the real world. Does your child, nephew, granddaughter, patient have a disorder that looks like Kamiyah’s? Let us know. If possible, send us a video, with the patient’s consent, naturally. Let’s help Kamiyah and her mother build their village and, with luck, find a treatment that works well for Kamiyah. First and last preferred, please.

27,GLENN KENNY,Hip-Hop dreamers negotiate the pitfalls of ‘The After Party’; watch the blockbuster “Baahubali” franchise on Netflix before a prequel series arrives.,2018-08-24 13:00:03,the-new-york-times,Streaming: ‘The After Party’ and ‘Baahubali’: Hip-hop Dreams and Indian Fantasy From Netflix,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/movies/the-after-party-baahubali-netflix.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/26/arts/26streaming/26streaming-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by Streaming By Glenn Kenny Iâd skimmed a couple of online accounts of the Netflix Original movie âThe After Partyâ before watching it (it debuted on Aug. 24), and got the impression that it was a down and dirty inside-hip-hop movie. It really isnât. Written and directed by Ian Edelman and produced in part by World Star Hip Hop (the movie is dedicated to that popular siteâs founder, Lee OâDenat, known as Q, who died in 2017), âThe After Partyâ is a young-adult comedy in hip-hop clothing. Sometimes the hip-hop trappings are deliberately unconvincing, as shown in a scene featuring Jeff (Harrison Holzer), the best friend and manager of Owen (Kyle Harvey, who raps in real life under the single name Kyle), two post-high-schoolers out for a big break. On the train home from an impromptu menâs room âauditionâ for a guy who turns out to be the unpaid intern for the record label bigwig they were hoping to impress, Jeff and Owen trade rhymes with a conductor who wonders if they know ârealâ hip-hop. After establishing their Rakim bona fides, the conductor says to Jeff, who is not just white but conspicuously white: âYour outfit is wow corny, son. Who you tryinâ to be?â To which Jeff sputters: âMyself. With a hint of the Migos.â He pauses and gulps. âIs it too much? Migos?â Humor of this kind suffuses the movie, which at its best is an amiable cartoon. When Owen gets too stoned to function at a hip-hop showcase, he projectile-vomits onto the real-life rapper Wiz Khalifa and passes out onstage; via viral video he earns the nickname Seizure Boy, and the movie has its joke two ways by endlessly repeating it and then having one of the characters whoâs parroting it make note of how objectionable the phrase is. Encouraged to join the Marines by his restaurant-owner dad (Blair Underwood, and itâs always nice to see him) Owen is hectored by Jeff to give him one last shot. Theyâve been promised a hearing from a label rep at a French Montana show the night before he heads to camp. Complicating matters is Owenâs longtime crush (more like fixation) on Jeffâs older sister, Alicia, whoâll also be attending. Not that the ensuing evening lacks for other challenges. It always does. On their way to the after-party (âNo matter how exclusive the party is, thereâs always gonna be a place more exclusive,â Jeff grouses) the two are obliged to hit a strip club, Thereâs a car-and-motorcycle chase that recalls a scene from âRisky Business.â Thereâs a 13-year-old mutineer from a bat mitzvah who snaps at Jeff and Owen, âCan you guys get me coke or not?â Thereâs a lot of cheerfully articulated sexism, which I presume Mr. Edelman presumes is mitigated by a couple of assertive female characters. I donât know about that. A vulgar turn of phrase concerning Owenâs not-entirely-noble intentions toward Jeffâs sister is repeated too often and with too much relish. For all of that, the movie is relentlessly fluffy. Mr. Edelman was the creator of the short-lived HBO series âHow to Make It in America,â which was notable for a not wholly inaccurate but largely toothless depiction of downtown New York mores; âThe After Partyâ makes âHow to Make Itâ look like âLast Exit to Brooklynâ by comparison. THIS MONTH NETFLIX announced that it would be creating an original series called âBaahubali: Before the Beginning,â with a premiere date yet to be announced. The first season of this Indian period fantasy epic will have nine episodes of unspecified lengths. The series is a prequel to two movies, âBaahubali: The Beginningâ (2015) and âBaahubali 2: The Conclusionâ (2017), which were huge hits, primarily with overseas theater audiences. (The second picture grossed $20 million in the United States.) They are both streaming on Netflix now. These Telugu-language films have, if not quite everything, then almost. A very convoluted plotline encompassing secret identities, royal intrigues and stealth tattooing. (Youâll know what Iâm talking about when you see it.) The action features swordplay, ax play, fist fighting, and C.G.I. bulls and elephants. The saga begins with a woman carrying a baby through rough river waters; she is forced to abandon it, and the infant is later found, floating, by villagers, and adopted. Every now and then the action stops so a character can make an impassioned speech about vengeance or justice. Or to allow the two romantic leads, Prabhas and Tamannaah â and later, others â to do a musical number, for which their everyday clothing is swapped for colorful, scanty costumes. Both movies are entertaining in that discursive way Bollywood movies are, and I was particularly intrigued by the appeal of Tamannaah, whoâs formidably sexy and strong. Iâm curious as to whether an episodic television series will replicate the rambling immersiveness of the movies. One of the most diverting original supplements on the Criterion Channel of the FilmStruck site is âAdventures in Moviegoing,â a series of interviews, each about 20 minutes long, in which a prominent figure in the arts talks movies. In the episode posting on Sept. 6, the interview subject is the director and performer Paul Feig, whose coming film, âA Simple Favor,â is a mystery, which is new territory for him. (But as itâs a mystery with women as its central characters, itâs in keeping with Mr. Feigâs raucous comedies, among them the 2011 film âBridesmaids.â) Interviewed by Sam Wasson (the author of an acclaimed biography of Bob Fosse), Mr. Feig amiably recalls the films that formed his tastes. From a blue-collar background, he had to teach himself when it came to art movies, but his mother had adventurous taste. When Mr. Feig was 12, she took him to see Robert Altmanâs âNashville,â which resulted in some awkwardness when a nude scene came up. As someone who wheedled his grandmother into taking him to see Hitchcockâs âFrenzyâ at age 13, I can both relate, and think I have him beat in the awkwardness department. There are about 20 episodes so far, and one thing that makes the series distinct is that the interviewees arenât always âmovie people.â The poet and memoirist Mary Karr and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jhumpa Lahiri are both interviewed by the writer and academic Antonio Monda (in my view the best-dressed professor at Tisch School of the Arts, where Iâm an adjunct). The basketball legend and prolific writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is interviewed by the terrific filmmaker Philip Kaufman. My buddy Bill Hader, the actor and co-creator of HBOâs âBarry,â and a cinephile of great range, is interviewed by Peter Becker, the president of the Criterion Collection. And so on. In a relatively quiet way, the Criterion Channel is bringing extras worthy of its physical media label to the FilmStruck site.   Advertisement",0.024,0.857,0.119,0.9987
28,https://www.nytimes.com/by/kevin-draper,The subscription-based hyperlocal sports website and app is growing quicker than any sports media company in recent memory. But can its expansion be sustained?,2018-08-24 10:37:37,the-new-york-times,Sports Site Hiring Spree Becomes Story in Itself...,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/sports/the-athletic-netflix.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/25/sports/25athletic1/25athletic1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by By Kevin Draper The Athletic, the hyperlocal sports website and app, is growing quicker than any sports media company in recent memory. This month, hardly a day passes without the announcement of a new hire. Or four. A football writer in New Orleans. A baseball writer in Cincinnati. An N.B.A. columnist and a college basketball editor. I'm excited to announce that I've joined @TheAthletic as an NFL features writer on our new @TheAthleticNFL vertical. I'll be staying in Denver, with the opportunity to tell stories from around the league. Here's why I've joined: https://t.co/xVnrd99tsk After 8 great yrs w/ the Charlotte Observer, fired up to announce I'm joining @TheAthleticCAR today. I'm still covering Panthers, just a bit differently.https://t.co/zcB8KDzSbq Just 10 months ago, when The Athletic celebrated its second birthday, the subscription-only website had 65 editorial employees in 10 markets. By the time the N.F.L. and college football seasons open next month, it will have more than 300 editorial employees, and sites focused on 38 markets. Backed by $28 million in venture capital, The Athletic long ago moved past simple questions like what to cover and where, to more existential ones: Can its rapid growth be sustained? Will it eventually make a profit? And why do its investors believe it will sail counter to the prevailing winds in media? Those answers are not easy to find, but the business plan at The Athletic is largely a bet that it will emerge as a Netflix-like solution to the decline of local sports coverage by newspapers decimated by budget cuts, and that it could eventually win over millions of subscribers. Its current hiring surge, then, is more a doubling down on that bet than a tangible payoff on it. Daniel Leff, the founder of Luminari Capital, which has invested in The Athletic, argued that the website is already worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and the only remaining question presently is how large it will grow. âThis is a company that has already achieved escape velocity,â he said. Without subscription figures or internal financial reports, Leffâs optimism is impossible to validate. Media companies like Netflix, Spotify and Sirius XM have tens of millions of subscribers paying monthly for their services, but few journalism companies approach those numbers. The New York Times leads newspapers with 2.9 million digital-only subscribers, and several magazines have circulations in the millions. Taylor Patterson, a spokeswoman for The Athletic, said the company has âwell overâ 100,000 subscribers, each paying about $5 each month. Leff, the investor, said it had âmany multiplesâ of 100,000. Its recent expansion has generated considerable skepticism, however, especially as the behemoths of media are merging and acquiring to achieve greater scale; other venture capital-backed midsize media companies like Buzzfeed and Vice are struggling to meet revenue targets; and local news organizations are withering. Brian Grey, who was the chief executive of Bleacher Report when the sports media company raised $33 million in investment capital and later was acquired by Turner Broadcasting for around $200 million, wonders if the Netflix or Spotify comparisons are accurate. âVideo and text are two different animals,â he said. âThe subscription and consumer willingness to pay for content may not map completely.â But to Leff, small-bore questions about expansion or profitability are missing the forest for the trees. âJust to get to 100,000 subscribers is a huge endeavor,â he said. âThey may or may not need additional capital to do it, but if so, so what? There are a multitude of capital sources that want to put money into this company.â When asked if The Athletic was already worth the $200 million Bleacher Report was acquired for six years ago, Leff responded: âAbsolutely. We wouldnât take that.â Still, The Athletic has received heavy criticism from the industry it hopes to dominate. In several markets, The Athletic has hired multiple writers away from the same newspaper, decimating the sports staffs at papers like The San Jose Mercury News and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among others. The Athleticâs initial practice of hiring mostly veteran writers without posting jobs publicly also has perpetuated homogeneity in an industry that is overwhelmingly white and male, leading to criticism. Since then, The Athletic has begun hiring more women and people of color, and the company participated in the recent National Association of Black Journalists convention in Detroit. At the same time, with the news industry under stress and as some have come to view supporting local journalism as a moral imperative, one of the founders of The Athletic, Alex Mather, told The Times last fall that his company would âwait every local paper out and let them continuously bleed until we are the last ones standing.â (Mather later apologized for his tone.) John Kosner is a former longtime ESPN digital media executive who oversaw ESPNâs failed attempt at creating local sites almost a decade ago. He cautioned that while The Athletic is off to a promising start, it would need to âsell an awful lot of subscriptions to become a big profitable enterprise.â But he also argued that The Athletic may be different from Netflix and Spotify in a crucial way: The Athleticâs first subscribers were avid fans who already spend thousands of dollars each year on sports. To get to its goal of millions of subscribers, Kosner warned, it eventually will have to attract casual fans, a far more difficult proposition. Netflix and Spotify had the opposite challenge; both found it hard to attract subscribers initially because they had small content libraries, but they grew quickly as they added more titles, a concept of steady, relentless growth known as the flywheel effect. âYes, you can go into new markets and get sports fans,â Kosner said of The Athleticâs recent growth. âBut it may not be as easy to continue to grow in these markets than it is to get started.â He predicted the end goal for The Athletic would be acquisition by a major media company, not a long-term future as an independent company. Patterson, the spokeswoman at The Athletic, said even converting just a percentage of die-hard sports fans into subscribers âwould result in a very healthy business for us.â She said the company has not seriously entertained any acquisition offers. Leff also believes there is a crucial difference from other subscription companies: Though Netflix increasingly produces original shows, it and Spotify are still mostly licensing companies. Combined, they have to pay billions to stock their services, while The Athletic creates 100 percent of its content. That content may be the crux of the challenge. Most of The Athleticâs writers, including many of its most recent hires, earned their following over years, or decades, at newspapers, a following they â and their new bosses â turn into Athletic subscribers. But stocking the site with newspaper veterans (there is also a very strong contingent of former âSports Illustratedâ journalists) means The Athletic often doesnât read that different from a newspaper sports section. At Netflix and Spotify, the compelling product is the video and the music. But in sports, the most compelling product isnât the writing. It is the games themselves, and Grey, the Bleacher Report veteran, wondered if that might be what The Athletic needs in order to truly scale its audience. âFacebook is buying rights to live games. Twitter is buying rights to live games,â Grey said. âThe Athletic may need to find itself moving in that direction.â Email Kevin Draper at kevin.draper@nytimes.com or follow him on Twitter: @kevinmdraper.

29,MIKE HALE,This new series about a 16-year-old with a strange power is on the brooding side of the mutant-teenager spectrum.,2018-08-23 18:16:37,the-new-york-times,"Review: ‘The Innocents’ on Netflix Is a Stylish, Slender Teen Romance",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/arts/television/the-innocents-review-netflix.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/24/arts/24theinnocents/24theinnocents-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by By Mike Hale From among the transformational metaphors for teenage alienation â turning into a vampire, turning into a human spider â âThe Innocents,â a handsome new Netflix series, goes with the plain vanilla variety. Its heroine, a 16-year-old British girl named June, is a basic shape-shifter, who takes on other peopleâs forms when sheâs frightened: a girl sheâs dancing with, a nurse, a burly Norwegian whoâs trying to kidnap her. Her ability is, in the nature of the teenage supernatural-science fiction melodrama, a curse whose benefits must be discovered gradually. In the case of âThe Innocents,â that process is very gradual, stretching across the eight episodes of the showâs first season (available Friday). The storyâs thinness is balanced by its stylishness, its broody romanticism and its charming leads, however, and itâs likely to find a large and enthusiastic audience. The young leads are Sorcha Groundsell and Percelle Ascott, consistently charming and believable as June and Harry, a Juliet and Romeo pair whose familiesâ woes are connected in mysterious ways. As the series opens, theyâre planning to go on the run because her smotheringly protective dad, aware of the power she has yet to discover, is about to move her to a remote Scottish island. Meanwhile, Guy Pearce, the one well-known member of the cast, monitors events from an achingly beautiful Norwegian fjord â straight out of a 19th-century Romantic poem, if youâre tracking influences. There his character, Halvorson, runs some sort of retreat and research facility, a Nordic version of the X-Menâs Xavier mansion. The two story lines converge almost immediately, and June and Harryâs flight â which carries them to London and then off across the North Sea â becomes a season-long quest to figure out whatâs wrong with her. The audience is on that same quest, because âThe Innocents,â for this season anyway, is one of the myriad ration-out-the-clues past-tense mysteries â as with âWestworld,â say, or âMarvelâs Cloak & Dagger,â itâs less about whatâs happening now than about what happened then. Much of the story is a slow buildup to some key flashbacks that take six or seven episodes to arrive. Though build isnât quite the right word. The story spins in place, with people chasing each other around in scenes and episodes that amount to stall tactics, until itâs finally time to bring everyone together for the answers. The showâs creators and primary writers, Hania Elkington and Simon Duric, are new to the showrunning game â heâs a longtime storyboard artist producing his first series, and sheâs a writer of short stories and hot but unproduced screenplays whoâs also bringing her first project to the screen. On the evidence of âThe Innocents,â neither of them yet knows or cares much about how to establish character through action. With the exception of the brave and impossibly noble Harry (Mr. Ascott gives the showâs most touching performance), people define themselves through talk, talk, talk, and the story isnât developed so much as uncovered. Ms. Elkington and Mr. Duric could also be a little more rigorous when it comes to narrative contrivances. One aspect of the shape-shifting premise â that shifters still look like themselves in mirrors or other reflections â is central to the plot but never explained, and feels like an irritating storytelling shortcut. (Itâs also awfully convenient that Harryâs mother is a detective with a cold case that connects her to Juneâs family.) These various quibbles largely arise from the creatorsâ choice to situate âThe Innocentsâ far to the teen-angst side of its particular scale, rather than the action-adventure side. It could fit easily on CW or Freeform, where it would be even more swoony and mopey than the rest of the lineup, though with a measure of British understatement. Scene by scene, as June and Harry beautifully dither to a soundtrack of mournful pop (Phoebe Bridgers, Sigrid, Autograf), the show is quite easy to watch. The shape-shifting premise proves a flexible, even powerful frame for the usual teenage quandaries â feeling different, being misunderstood by clueless parents, wanting to explore other, kinkier modes of life. A scene in which June encounters another shifter and risks losing her own identity altogether delivers some real emotion. In the highly likely second season, perhaps the pace will pick up.

30,Angela Watercutter,Ever-morphing movie and marquee-show releases have upended conventional wisdom about when new content hits screens.,2018-08-27 11:00:00,wired,"So Long, Fall TV: Big Year-Round Releases Flip the Script",https://www.wired.com/story/sharp-objects-year-round-tv/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b8043aa385cec3f290b9740/191:100/pass/SharpObjects1.jpg,"Sharp Objects, the latest limited-series drama from HBO, ended in blockbuster fashion last night. After a mind-splitting investigation into the mysterious deaths of several young girls in Wind Gap, Missouri, journalist Camille Preaker (Amy Adams) finally finds some answers, and a killer is put behind bars. Except it's not over. As the credits roll, the show's final twist is revealed, completely overhauling the tidy ending the audience just watched. The post-credits sequence looked like something right out of the Marvel playbook, except it was for a psychological thriller on HBO. Then again, HBO has been using Marvel's playbook for years. Not literally, of course. The Sharp Objects reversal-of-fortune aside, HBO's bread and butter is still dramas and comedies, not superheroes. But the idea that capes and explosions and sci-fi rule the summer is quickly fading away. Not only have premium cable channels and streaming services decided to roll out their own powerhouse offerings during the dog days of summer, but movie studiosâwho used to keep their popcorn-ready releases locked and loaded between Memorial Day and Labor Dayânow send them to theaters almost any time of year they like, audience expectations be damned. The idea of the Summer Movie Season and the Fall TV Season are over; welcome to the Year of All Entertainment All the Time. The Real Reason The Meg Feasted at the Box Office What Black Pantherâs Success Means for the Future of Movies Goodreads and the Crushing Weight of Literary FOMO This is by no means a sudden arrival; it's been accumulating over time. True Detective and Game of Thrones taking up a lot of people's spring screen time? That was a something new. Stranger Things capturing as much of the July pop culture conversation as The BFG? That was a moment, too. Remember when Alice in Wonderland broke $100 million during the first weekend of March in 2010? That was a huge shift in Hollywood's thinkingâone that was followed a few years later by Deadpool winning over movie-goers' hearts in February, traditionally a dead zone for boffo box office weekends. (It made a record-shattering $132 million when it opened.) ""As certain periods of the year got really crowded, movie distributors said, 'OK, we need to look at a different time of the year,'"" says Phil Contrino, head of media and research for the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO). ""And when they did, and the movie succeeded, the lesson learned was that people don't look at the calendar to decide whether they go to the movies or not."" But even though this has been creeping on for almost a decade, in 2018 year-round tentpoles became the modus operandi for both TV/film studios and audiences. For one, Black Panther came out in February and obliterated Deadpool's record with a $200-million-plus opening weekend, making it the biggest February opening and the fifth-largest domestic opening ever. That was then followed by Avengers: Infinity War hitting theaters on April 27 and a whole slew of premium TV offeringsâfrom Killing Eve to Pose to Successionâairing between May and August, a period that a decade ago would've hosted an endless supply of reruns. Much of this activity, of course, has been spurred by streaming. Even though cable networks like HBO were the first to find value in dropping a show like Game of Thrones in April, Netflix and its ilk have taken the idea and run with it, releasing shows like Narcos, Orange Is the New Black, and The Handmaidâs Tale during the days when audiences are typically expected to be out in theatersâor just outside in general. (Netflix and HBO declined to comment for this story; their programming heads remain full of secrets.) The opposite has occurred with movies, as Hollywood has become more comfortable in recent years with releasing big popcorn movies during the typically dead months like September or March. And while it may be counterintuitive, the two forms of media don't cannibalize each other. According to a study done by NATO earlier this year, people who frequent movie theaters also tend to watch more streaming content than those who don't hit the cineplex as often. This doesn't mean that everything has changed, or that much more will. Networks will still release standard fall primetime TV slates, along with midseason replacements in January. Marvel, Warner Bros./DC, Lucasfilm, and the like will still vie to be the Kings of Summer and/or the December holiday season. But the idea of ""dump months"" is, according to Contrino, ""completely gone."" There is no longer any time during the year that's considered a cinematic dead zoneâweekends filled with movies studios just want to get rid of. And now that subscription services like MoviePass, Sinemia, and AMCâs Stubs A-List are making movies part of folksâ monthly routines, chances are the trend will only continue. Itâs possible, however, that new time-stamped patterns will emerge. While the Oscars and Golden Globes will ensure the permanence of ""awards season""âthe final push to release prestige movies during November and Decemberâstreaming platforms wading into contention means that Netflix and Amazon Prime may start flooding the zone around then as well. And now that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has added a new ""popular film"" category, perhaps studios will save a few of their summer blockbusters for the fall. Looking at the month ahead, it seems like some of them already have. In a couple of weeks, Shane Black's new Predator movie hits theaters; a week after that Amazon is releasing its Oscar-Isaac-starring Oscar bait Life Itself, from This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman. October, which is typically packed with nothing but ghost stories and scream queens, will bring with it Venom, Bradley Cooper's reboot of A Star Is Born with Lady Gaga, Drew Goddard's Bad Times at the El Royale, and director Damien Chazelle's Neil Armstrong biopic, First Man. Oh, and, for the horror fans, there's a new Halloween movie, which could burn through the box office much like one particular scary clown did last year around this time. To borrow a phrase from Field of Dreamsâwhich came out in April, it should be notedâif you make it, they will come. ""It was underestimated how much the market has the ability to expand,"" Contrino says. ""There was this notion that, 'We got them in the summer, and then we're going to get them again in November and December during the holidays, and we should really not risk trying to get them again in September. Then look at last year, It was released in September and made $123 million. Nobody ever thought that would happen. But if people wanna see something, theyâre gonna go."" And from the look of things, they'll be doing that all year long. The Russo brothers, directors of 'Avengers: Infinity War,' break down every single hero that appears in the movie. Anthony and Joe go through all the heroes in 'Infinity War' and talk about every character's role in the film, as well as their backstories.

31,Brian Barrett,"It doesn't get much better than the lighthearted show—which should come as no surprise, given its lineage.",2018-08-24 11:00:00,wired,"'Ask the StoryBots': The Long, Internetty History of the Best Kids' Show on Netflix",https://www.wired.com/story/ask-the-storybots-netflix/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7ee7c1385cec3f290b9700/191:100/pass/Storybots-2.jpg,"On a late June day in 2012, Gregg and Evan Spiridellis uploaded five videos to YouTube. Each featured a quintet of monochromatic cartoon robots, catchy songs, and an educational slant. Six years, 150 songs, and 500 million views later, StoryBots is now a kidâs entertainment empire. It also just happens to be one of the best shows on Netflix, with the second season of Ask the StoryBots arriving on the streaming provider today. None of this should come as a surprise if you recognize the name of the StoryBots creators. If ""Spiridellis"" doesnât ring a bell, JibJab might; thatâs the company they founded in 1999. Or better still, if you were on the internet in any capacity in 2004, you almost certainly had their satirical video âThis Land!ââa riff on that yearâs presidential race by way of Arlo Guthrie, in which John Kerry warbles that George W. Bush is a âstupid dumbassâârepeatedly hammered into your brain. The Spiridellis brothers have been making popular internet videos for nearly two decades, which online equals several lifetimes of relevance. As with all good stories, though, the fun part is the journey: How two guys who went supernova at the dawn of Web 2.0 went on to craft one of the funniest, smartest, most delightful childrenâs shows of recent memory. Starring robots. âThis Land!â wasnât just viral. It was all-encompassingâpopular in a way that videos in todayâs fragmented, platformized internet no longer can be. There was still such a thing as mass culture in 2004, and for a few weeks that summer, JibJab was it. âThis was pre-YouTube,â says Gregg. âOf anyone who saw video on the internet in July of 2004, I would bet for 90-plus percent of them, our video was in the mix. That share of voice doesnât exist anymore.â The video landed Gregg and Evan on The Tonight Show. ABC News put them among their People of the Year. JibJab would go on to tally 80 million views through the campaign season. Today, that would be a weak performance for a Taylor Swift video; in 2004, when only 25 percent of US adults had broadband at home and the iPhone was just a glimmer in Cupertinoâs eye, it was a revelation. The Spiridellis brothers also took it as a sign. âWhen we were doing âThis Land!â you could create one thing that would appeal to 100 million people. The internet hadnât been split into a billion niches yet,â says Gregg. âBut what we realized was, as good as we might be in terms of creating really funny little shorts, there was no way we were going to keep pumping out hits that big.â JibJab continued to make funny videos, it just did so less frequently. Meanwhile, the duo focused their business efforts on making funny greeting cards that let you insert a photo of your face. That started in 2007, presaging the internet's appetite for hyper-personalization. (See: Bitmoji.) The business is still up and running. But along the way, Gregg and Evan had kids. And in the vast saccharine wasteland of childrenâs entertainment, they saw an opportunity. When the JibJab brothers embarked on their kids-content quest, they started at the front of the alphabet. âHooray for A,â the very first StoryBots video, doesnât closely resemble more recent fare. The animation is more straightforward, and the songâs lessonââaâ is a letter, and here are some words that start with itâisnât all that ambitious. But in it, you can see the outlines of an overarching philosophy. Itâs funny. Itâs self-aware. Most of all, itâs an earworm. The StoryBots spent that first year working methodically through the alphabet, with the occasional spin on a classicâthe StoryBots version of âJumping on the Bedâ has 35 million viewsâthrown in for good measure. But in 2015, they began to branch out. That summer, the Spiridellis brothers released thematically linked sets of songs: outer space, animals, seasons. Then came body parts, time, vehicles, shapes. Colors, emotions. The works. Each song lasts no more than a minute or two. But even in that small parcel of time, each tosses out irresistible facts, jokes, and hooks. Just as importantly, they explore a sweeping range of musical styles and artistic mediums. âWhen You Breathe (Lungs)â sounds like Jack Johnson and looks traditionally 2-D. âLetâs Wait for Yellowâ uses stop-motion, and in a just world would be the song of the summer. Pastels, live-action, 3-D animation; hip-hop, folk, pop. For all the facts and figures you can learn from the StoryBots YouTube channel, the genre education might be even better. As for what song or style gets assigned to which subject, thatâs an inexact science. âSometimes thereâll be an artist that inspires us, and weâll say oh, we can craft a world like this. Sometimes weâll come up with a story format, like a western, and itâs gotta be done like this,â says Gregg. And sometimes it just feels right, the brothers agreeâlike a series of educational outer space songs set to hip-hop beats. Regardless of medium, the videos were a hit. The StoryBots have notched 12 million views for a song about trucks, and 29 million for a breakdown of the planets. A five-song series about dinosaurs collectively racked up another 60 million. That popularity emboldened the brothers Spiridellis to take the natural next step: Make a television show. âWe knew people liked it. We made something parents liked. We could look at comments, we could get their feedback,â says Gregg. âThat gave us confidence,â adds Evan. âWe went out and we produced this thing.â They lined up a celebrity lead in Judy Greer, who plays lead bot Beep. They called in high-profile guest stars, like Jay Leno and Tim Meadows. And they set to work giving their 90-second morsels of smart, catchy kid songs a narrative arc, building out the world they had created. Each episode of Ask the StoryBots on Netflix follows a relatively simple formula. The five botsâBeep, Boop, Bing, Bang, and Boâare tasked with answering a question, and spend the next 22 minutes or so doing just that, through songs and comedic interludes. The first seasonâs subjects range from the standard issue (why is the sky blue?) to the slightly more arcane but probably more important (where do french fries come from?). The pure fun of it all belies the plate-spinning act that makes it possible. âOne of the things that sticks out to me is how many things it does well all at once,â says Polly Conway, senior editor of TV reviews for Common Sense, a nonprofit focused on how children interact with media. âJust the way they can switch from a song back to the original plot, and then itâs live action, but then itâs green-screen, and then itâs claymation. In lesser hands it could be overwhelming, and too much, especially for the age group that theyâre targeting. But itâs just really fun, and itâs funny.â Take the very first episode: âHow Does Night Happen?â To find the answer, the StoryBots crew visits a knight (live action), explores the ocean (2-D animation), and takes in a lesson from the sun itself (stop-motion). Songs about the letter N (perhaps best described as They Might Be Giants-esque), the color red (rap) and chickens (upbeat pop) provide narrative breaks. Thereâs an extended sequence of sight gags at the beach. Itâs a lotâbut it somehow never feels like too much. Critics agree. Ask the StoryBots won two Emmys this year for its Christmas specialâstarring Ed Asner as Santa Clausâand has been nominated for a pile more. It was one of just two childrenâs shows to be a Peabody Award finalist in 2017 (the other was Amazonâs Tumble Leaf, also excellent). And groups like Common Sense, the Webby Awards, and the British Academy Childrenâs Awards have heaped praise as well. âI think itâs unique in that a lot of shows are very niche at this point. Thereâs a show called Annedroids, and itâs about engineering and science. Or thereâs Daniel Tiger, which is all about feelings. Shows trying to really hyper-focus. StoryBots is just like, weâre just going to learn about everything! That I think is pretty ambitious, but they manage to do it super well,â says Conway. Itâs also relentlessly informative. âOn the short-form videos,"" Gregg says, ""weâll go to a educator and say, 'we want to do a series on outer space, we want to produce five videos. What five topics should we do? Under those five topics, what are the 15 key facts we should try to get across in the song?'"" â'And then give us a bunch of other stuff that we can weave in if we can make it entertainment,'â says Evan, finishing Greggâs thought. âWhat are the tentpoles we have to hit from a learning standpoint, and then what are other lessons that would be valuable but not as critical?â That input from educatorsâspecialists in various fields, educational psychology PhDs, and so onâcontinues throughout the development process of both individual songs and television episodes. At various points along the way, the team checks back in to make sure everything makes sense. For the TV show specifically, every writing exercise starts with the âlesson recap,â the part at the end where the StoryBots explain what theyâve learnedâwhy the sky is, in fact, blueâin a minute or less. Once an educator signs off, the team can go on to fill in the rest. These are also heavy hitters; the creation of season two episode âHow Do People Catch a Cold,â for instance, took several calls with the head of virology at UCLA. That rigor maybe shouldnât come as a surprise; itâs an educational show, after all. But itâs worth noting, if only because Ask the StoryBots has that remarkable quality where you donât realize youâre learning in the first place. Youâre having too much fun. Season two should follow that same roadmap, with stops for guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Edward Norton, Wanda Sykes, and more thrown in. And while the show will still dip into the back catalog for musical interludes, half the songs this time around will be brand new. It will also reach more kids than ever. While season one only hit select markets, all eight episodes of the follow-up will launch on Netflix globally, translated into 22 languages. Even without the show, the StoryBots are becoming hard to miss. In Hollywood, itâs unusual for creators to use their own money; Netflix has at least an $8 billion budget for original content this year because it usually foots the bill. But for Gregg and Evan, independence was paramount. By putting millions up front into the creation of Ask the StoryBots, they retained the rights to all of its associated intellectual property. Owning every aspect of StoryBots means that the characters can continue to thrive not just on YouTube, but elsewhere online and even in schools, a burgeoning educational empire that Gregg and Evan hope will become this generationâs Sesame Street. (For what itâs worth, despite the change of address to premium cable, Sesame Street still bangs.) Thereâs StoryBots Classroom, which 70,000 teachers across the US use to incorporate the characters into lessons. The StoryBots website encompasses songs, math problems, and digital books, most of whichâin a JibJabian touchâyou can insert your childâs face into for a personalized experience. A line of physical books occupies shelf space at Target. âTelevision is just one piece of what we see as all these canvasses we can paint in all different places with the stories and characters,â says Gregg. âWe see the StoryBots as living in an unlimited number of mediums.â Beep, Boop, Bing, Bang, and Bo may still never be as ubiquitous as âThis Land!â But does a kidsâ show in 2018 really need to be? That question doesnât take 22 minutes to answer: It just needs to be smart, and funny, and creative, and kind. 'The Lego Batman Movie' uses an impressive style of animation that replicates the look of real lego bricks. These digital bricks abide by all the rules of real Lego bricks, so they cannot bend or move in an impractical way. Mike Seymour breaks down a few of the most remarkable scenes, where numerous complex techniques were used to create a believable image. CNMN Collection © 2018 CondÃ© Nast. All rights reserved.
