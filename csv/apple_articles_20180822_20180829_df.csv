A piece of computer history that helped launch a trillion dollar company is hitting the auction block. 
A fully functioning Apple-1 being auctioned by Boston-based RR Auction in September is one of only 60 or so remaining of the original 200 that were designed and built by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976 and 1977. 
It was restored to its original, operational state by Apple expert Corey Cohen. The system was operated without fault for approximately eight hours in a test. It even includes the original keyboard from the 1970s. 
It shows the humble beginnings of Cupertino, California-based Apple, which recently became the world's first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion. 
The Apple 1 originally sold for about $666. It could get $300,000 or more at auction.",0.021,0.873,0.106,0.8611

One of these exciting new features is that the app can now turn your BluetoothÂ®-enabled mobile phone into a digital key that unlocks your hotel room door, representing another seamless room entry option for guests to use in addition to their MagicBands. This technology made its initial debut at Disneyâs Wilderness Lodge earlier this year, and this week, we are completing its rollout to Disney Resort hotels at Walt Disney World Resort, including Disney Vacation Club properties. Using a digital key can help add convenience and flexibility to your stay, whether you simply prefer the look and feel of your mobile phone or if you need a backup option after accidentally locking yourself out of your room (it happens to the best of us). The feature was designed with a distinctly Disney touch, and if you listen closely, youâll hear the sound of pixie dust filling the air as your hotel door opens. Guests can also use their digital key to unlock the hotel entrance gate and common area doors requiring a key, which may include fitness centers, elevators and club level lounges. And arriving travel parties that have checked in online may even use their digital key to bypass the front desk, similar to what they are able to do with the MagicBand, giving them the opportunity to go directly to their room when it is ready and start their vacation even faster.  Each guest staying in the room with a My Disney Experience account may opt in and activate the feature on their check-in day through a brief set up process in the app. To enter their room, guests tap the âUnlock Doorâ button and then simply hold their phone against the door lock. This is the latest in the evolution of keyless room entry, which began with the MagicBand, the unique all-in-one device that allows you to effortlessly access the plans and vacation choices youâve made in My Disney Experience. Guests can choose to use either or both options for room entry throughout their trip, but please remember to wear your MagicBand for all other uses, including park entry, FastPass+ redemption, linking Disney PhotoPass images and more. Be sure to download the latest version of My Disney Experience today for iOS or Android to opt in and activate your digital key during your Disney Resort hotel stay and discover all of the other great features in the app. Apple is a trademark of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.

Apple confirmed it acquired Longmont, Colorado-based Akonia Holographics. ""Apple buys smaller companies from time to time, and we generally don't discuss our purpose or plans,"" the iPhone maker said in a statement.   Akonia could not immediately be reached for comment. The company was founded in 2012 by a group of holography scientists and had originally focused on holographic data storage before shifting its efforts to creating displays for augmented reality glasses, according to its website.   In augmented reality, digital information is overlaid on the real world as in the popular game Pokemon Go. Mobile phones use their camera system to do this on the phone's screen, but major technology firms are racing to create glasses that will show digital information on transparent lenses.   Akonia said its display technology allows for ""thin, transparent smart glass lenses that display vibrant, full-color, wide field-of-view images."" The firm has a portfolio of more than 200 patents related to holographic systems and materials, according to its website.   Akonia also said it raised $11.6 million in seed funding in 2012 and was seeking additional funding. It was unclear whether that funding ever materialized or who the firm's investors were.   The purchase price and date of the acquisition could not be learned, though one executive in the augmented reality industry said the Akonia team had become ""very quiet"" over the past six months, implying that the deal may have happened in the first half of 2018.   Apple has a history of buying smaller companies whose technologies show up years later in its products. In 2013, Apple acquired a small Israeli firm called PrimeSense that made three-dimensional sensors. The iPhone X, launched last year, used a similar sensor to power facial recognition features.   Bloomberg last year reported that Apple was developing augmented reality glasses that could ship as early as 2020. Apple declined to comment on its plans or products.                                                                           But the company last year launched augmented reality applications for its iPhones and iPads, and CEO Tim Cook has called augmented reality a ""big and profound"" technology development.   ""This is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it,"" Cook said of augmented reality on a conference call with investors last year.   The Akonia acquisition is the first clear indication of how Apple might handle one of the most daunting challenges in augmented reality hardware: Producing crystal clear optical displays thin and light enough to fit into glasses similar to everyday frames with images bright enough for outdoor use and suited to mass manufacturing at a relatively low price.   Augmented reality headsets currently on the market such as Microsoft Corp's HoloLens and startup Magic Leap's Magic Leap One both use darkened lenses and are intended for indoor use. Both are also intended for software developers testing the technology and cost several thousand dollars.   ",0.012,0.906,0.082,0.9878

It's part of a huge stock award dating back to 2011, when he took over as CEO. The stock is in addition to Cook's salary, which was just over $3 million in 2017.   Every year, if Apple outperforms two-thirds of the S&P; 500 index, Cook receives a huge slug of previously restricted shares of Apple, which he can then sell or hold. (Apple's total shareholder return ranked 50th out of the 423 companes in the S&P; 500 over the past three years,  according to the Financial Times.)   These large slugs of stock make Cook one of the most highly-paid executives in the tech industry.   ""Cook has been one of the highest paid CEOs in the tech industry over the past seven years, and Apple's stock price has nearly quadrupled since he was granted 7 million shares when he first became CEO,"" Alex Knowlton, senior research analyst at Equilar, an executive compensation research firm, said in an email.   In total, Cook has collected more $650,382,235 in stock awards since he became CEO. After adding salary, and other bits of compensation, he's collected $701 million in pay since 2011, according to Equilar's analysis. Even after Tuesday's sales, he still holds over 800,000 shares of Apple, worth over $195,000,000 on Wednesday's opening price of $220.15.   Apple stock forms the bulk of Cook's net worth. But he also has income from his job on Nike's board of directors, and could also make money from other investments. Still, Equilar estimated last fall that a low estimate for his net worth would be around $625 million, based on Apple's stock price at the time.   ""The only other CEO who has realized more value in the same time period is Mark Zuckerberg, who exercised 1.2 million options over two years,"" Knowleton continued. The Facebook CEO's options had a strike price of $0.06, making his options over the same time worth almost $5.8 billion.   Other tech executives are quickly catching up.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk and  Snap CEO Evan Spiegel both have received massive stock grants recently. Musk's was valued on paper at as much as $2.6 billion. Speigel's received $638 million as an award for taking his company public. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has collected over $404 million in stock since he took over in 2015, according to Equilar data.                                                                                               Other tech executives, particularly founders, aren't compensated with equity — they already hold enough from when they founded the company.   ""[Amazon CEO] Jeffrey Bezos, [Google cofounders] Lawrence Page, and Sergey Brin have not been compensated with equity over the years, with Page and Brin both taking $1 salaries,"" Knowlton said.   Cook plans to give the majority of his fortune to charity. Earlier this month, he transferred  $5 million in Apple stock to a charity an Apple representative declined to name at the time.   Apple became the first American company with a $1 trillion market cap earlier this month.

A device  sold by 321dady seems to be an iPhone that was used for testing inside Apple in late 2006, before the iPhone was revealed to the world by Steve Jobs in 2007.   Apple fans have bid on the item 72 times, bringing the price to over $13,000 on Wednesday. The 10-day auction still has several days before it closes.   The listing says the phone runs Earthbound, an internal Apple operating system that provides access to testing and development tools, as well as Apple OS X, a desktop operating system. When the iPhone launched in 2007, Jobs said it ran a full version of OS X.                                              Screenshot/Ebay                                      According to the listing, the device was handmade, has custom internal hardware, and is heavier than the iPhone that was eventually released. The listing says it's a ""DVT"" prototype, or a  design verification testing device, meaning it was produced before ""PVT"" testing, the engineering stage before mass production.   According to the listing, this phone was previously listed on eBay in 2015, when bidding reached $61,000.   However, that eBay listing was taken down, and the device was eventually sold privately for $8,000, according to a person with knowledge of the prototype phone who is not the seller.   ""This is definitely one of the rarer units,"" the person told Business Insider.   Apple prototypes are of heavy interest to a certain subculture of Apple fans who collect prerelease prototypes and nonpublic Apple software.   Prototype devices like this one were often given to or taken by Apple engineers at the end of a project as a souvenir, according to collectors in the community, and some of them eventually make their way onto the market.   Typically, Apple doesn't acknowledge the market for these unreleased but obsolete devices unless they are traded on public forums like Craigslist and eBay.

Rumors about the new phones include changes in display, storage, and RAM. Here's what we know about them. Following is a transcript of the video.  Text on screen: Apple might introduce three new iPhones this year — here's what we know. The iPhone might finally ditch the ""Home"" button and all three models will be full-screen, like last year's iPhone X. All the new phones will have the TrueDepth camera that enables Face ID and the notch that it requires. One phone will have an LCD screen, while two others will be higher-end, with more expensive AMOLED screens. AMOLED screens have richer colors than LCD screens, and tend to use less power. The LCD version is meant to replace the iPhone 8 and will simply be called ""iPhone"" — without a number. It's rumored to have a 6.1"" screen with a resolution of 320-330 PPI.  The AMOLED models are rumored to have 4GB of RAM with the LCD model having 3 GB. These may be the possible storage options. The higher-end models may support the Apple Pencil.   Apple may include USB-C to Lightning cables and an 18W USB-C power adapter with all the phones. This would enable fast charging out of the box.   The LCD iPhone is rumored to start around $699 to $749. The 5.8"" iPhone X may be priced around $899 to $949. And the 6.5"" will probably start around $999.   Apple will probably debut the new models early September.",0.005,0.96,0.035,0.8115

Trump used to criticize Apple during the presidential campaign, but since the election he's dined with CEO Tim Cook and has praised the company's announcement that it plans to spend hundreds of billions in the United States on suppliers and other expenses.

Ad The companyâs latest model, Oneplus 6, was widely praised - with 1 million sold within a month of launch. In an interview with BI Nordic, the Swedish-Chinese entrepreneur discusses Oneplusâ success, the ascent of China, and more. Early on, Carl Pei understood that China, consumer tech and e-commerce would change the world. Those insights, gained during a visit to China as a teenager, would soon pull Pei into the booming world of consumer tech. Even before he could finish his bachelorâs thesis at university, Pei was out of patience. Ad âChina was mentioned zero times, the big tech companies zero times, and we learned nothing about e-commerce,â the Swedish-Chinese entrepreneur once commented his time at the esteemed Stockholm School of Economics. Aged 21, Carl Pei dropped out and moved to China to pursue his passion for gadgets. Fast forward a few years and his company Oneplus is raking in a billion dollars per year. In the process, it revolutionized the Android smartphone universe and established itself as a serious challenger to giants like Apple and Samsung.  Founded in Shenzen by CEO Pete Lau together with Carl Pei in 2013, OnePlus introduced a premium Android phone rivalling the iPhone but selling for much less. The cheap price tag was achieved by cutting out middlemen and using e-commerce as the primary sales channel. Business Insider Nordic recently caught up with Carl Pei to get the latest on OnePlus, the companyâs new iPhone X-challenger, and why the entrepreneur is sending Swedish students to China for a first-hand peek at the Wild East.  The breakout success of Oneplus: âWhen we started out, there were many Android-makers who wouldnât pay attention to the product: there were unnecessary features like heart-rate monitors, and they were made of plastic [..]. We thought that there must be Android users who wanted a neat product, just like Apple fans do.â Oneplus 6 being compared to iPhone X: â[When it comes to Apple], itâs really the features and not the product that weâre inspired by. Apple today is number one and itâs not a surprise that people make comparisons. Iâm not super happy about that, because I believe we can stand out on our own.â  Why Sweden risks losing its status as a unicorn factory: âWhenever I visit Sweden, I notice people arenât taking notice of China. Swedes are still mostly following whatâs going in the United States, but at the same time, the US is starting to look at China. So Iâm quite worried that Sweden wonât be able to keep building unicorns simply because the world is changing faster than [the West] understands.â Why AR/VR wonât replace the smartphone: âNobody is using VR right now; even if you have goggles, theyâre collecting dust on the shelf because thereâs no real use cases right now. We havenât seen that happen for AR either. The smartphone is still the center of peoplesâ digital lives and will be so for the foreseeable future.â What are your thoughts on the reception of the Oneplus 6? Youâve so far sold more than 1 million units in less than three months.  âIt took our first model about a year to reach one million units sold. This time it took 22 days. For each phone we launch, we keep selling faster, and a bigger amount of phones. The OnePlus 6 is our best phone so far and the sales are going very well.â What has been the customersâ favorite features of the phone? âPeople like the overall experience, but especially the camera. Indeed the camera is one of the most important functionalities for smartphone users, and weâve made some great progress with the OnePlus 6.â How important is customer feedback? âThe community is very important for our product development. In Sweden, we recently arranged an event for gathering product and customer relationship feedback. Then we brainstormed some action points around this feedback in order to improve our offering.â So itâs an ongoing part of your product development, to listen to customers? âTo listen, yes, but also to filter â what do our customers really want? Their wishes arenât always compatible with reality, so you need to understand their core problem and what they really mean by their feedbackâ. âFor instance, with the Oneplus One, many customers protested against a 5,5 inch screen and though it too big. But we made sure to round out the corners which gave the phone the feel of a 5-inch phone.â Word-of-mouth is an important marketing tool for Oneplus. Explain?  âItâs more genuine and efficient to make a good product and have your customers spread the word instead of spending on banners and TV-ads. Thatâs what weâve always bet on.â Why did you originally decide to start OnePlus and challenge the likes of Apple and Samsung? âWeâre trying to build the most balanced smartphone and the best user experience. When we started out, there were many Android-makers who wouldnât pay attention to the product: there were unnecessary features like heart-rate monitors; they were made of plastic and overall not good phones. We thought that there must be Android users who wanted a neat product, just like Apple fans do. Weâre always trying to create what we think is the best possible Android phone out there.â Business Insider recently drew parallels between your new OnePlus 6 and the Iphone X, albeit for much cheaper price. What do you have to say about that? âItâs really the features and not the product that were inspired by the iPhone. Apple spends a lot of time and energy on quality, design and user experience. Thatâs what weâre also striving for. Apple today is number one and itâs not a surprise that people make comparisons with them. Iâm not super happy about that, I believe we can stand out on our own.â  Read More: The 20 Best Smartphones in the World Read More: A million people bought this $530 Android-powered iPhone competitor in less than a month Nevertheless, part of your success has been that youâve combined some of the strengths of an Apple phone with the affordability of the Android range. How important is price? âWeâre out to build what we think is the best possible product, and then we determine the price accordingly. Actually, we are part of the more expensive end of the flagship phone market but we still want to be cheaper than the premium phones.â âRetail is expensive for manufacturers, as you need to pay rent and sales staff. We donât have that, we have a relatively small team for a smartphone maker. Our marketing mainly takes place on the internet, which is much more efficient than buying big banners or TV ads.â âWe can reinvest the money we save in making a better phone, but also in a better price for the consumer. To be low-cost is nothing we strive for. In Europe, the average smartphone costs 200 euros, so weâre in fact part of the higher end flagship market. Thereâs a lot of room for growth - especially in Europe where a higher proportion of people can afford flagship phones.â Youâre originally from China, but grew up in Sweden. What are the challenges of expanding in China, given that one has a general understanding of the market?  âIf you have a good product, then it will be a good product whether youâre in Sweden or in China. Take Apple for example, or Swedish watchmaker Daniel Wellington; both are selling extremely well in China. Of course, there are challenges, especially as it is a completely different marketing- and internet ecosystem. Foreign companies may want to get used to marketing on WeChat, and to learn how you play the local market.â  China is moving fast, and youâre passionate about communicating this to your home country, Sweden. Do you have an example of how fast-paced China is? âThings happen really fast over there. For instance, Shenzhen recently said that all taxi cars in the city need to be electric by the end of the year. In one more year, all cars will have to be electric. When something gets decided, it really happens fast.â  âThe service sector is also more fast-paced due to stiffer competition. For instance, I recently used a service for repainting the walls in my apartment. Despite me being away in Europe, it took just days. The painting firm created a Wechat group, where they posted photos of the apartment so I could follow the progress from afar. So when I was back, all the furniture was back and my walls had a different color. In Sweden, this would take two months during the holiday season.â You recently launched a new exchange program for Swedish students to spark their interest in Chinese business and tech. Tell us more about the thinking behind this initiative? âUntil recently, Sweden had the highest proportion of Fortune 500 companies per capita. The countryâs been very successful, but if we donât keep up with developments and start taking cues from China, we risk falling behind.â âHaving lived in China for a long time now and have seen the rapid development of the tech sector there, but whenever I visit Sweden I notice people arenât taking notice. Swedes are still mostly following whatâs going in the United States, but at the same time, the US is starting to look at what happens in China. So Iâm quite worried that Sweden wonât be able to keep building unicorns simply because the world is changing faster than [the West] understands.â âExplore Chinaâ will take 16 promising Swedish students and send them over for an immersive tour of Chinese tech. âOver two weeks, they will visit companies including Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba, as well as local Swedish entrepreneurs, across three cities: Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing. Theyâll get to test mobile payments with WeChat, try out dockless bikes, and then theyâll be able to return to Sweden and spread that knowledge and inspiration to other people.â  âHopefully, the students can become a bridge between Sweden and China, people who understand both cultures. So when they found the next Spotify, theyâll be able to see China as a massive growth market.â  What entrepreneurial advice would you give the students in your cohort? âPursue something that you love. It may sound like a clichÃ©, but to achieve something important will take so much time and effort, you need to make sure you enjoy what youâre doing. Otherwise, itâs easy to give up.â How much do you work each day? âA bit less compared to when we first started out. I would guess around 10 and 12 hours per day.â Whatâs the one signature skill of Carl Pei? âIâve been fortunate enough to be exposed to both Western and Asian culture. That means Iâm able to see connections between the two continents. Other than that, I donât think Iâm special. But since Iâm exposed to more information I can more easily put together new ideas.â Thereâs plenty of people who say that the smartphone will die, and will be replaced by AR. Do you agree? âIt wonât happen. VR was also supposed to replace smartphones, but it didnât happen either. Nobody is using VR right now; even if you have goggles, theyâre collecting dust on the shelf because thereâs no real use cases right now. We havenât seen that happen for AR either, despite many years of hype.â So we wonât be living immersed inside a pair of glasses, after all? âSmartphones are still the center of peoplesâ digital lives and will be so for the foreseeable future, at least for the next decade.â Is it a coincidence that you pursued smartphones to fulfil your ambitions? âIâve always been interested in smartphones. Back in the days, I created themes for SonyEricssonâs 610, the candybar phone, so Iâve always had a keen interest for technology and phones. Itâs the most impactful product for all of humanity. Everybody uses it every day, and it makes up the single biggest technology market available today.â  Your father was very worried when you dropped out of university. What does he have to say today? âNothing. Except that heâs happy, and perhaps a bit proud too.â *Copyright Â© 2016 Business Insider Inc / Bonnier Business Media Sweden AB.

You can attach some of Motorola's ""Moto Mods"" to give it some extra features that you wouldn't find on any other smartphone, like a projector, an extra loud speaker, or a larger battery pack. The flagship Moto Mod is a 5G module that will let the Moto Z3 connect to Verizon's 5G network, which should offer blisteringly fast data speeds. The only problem is that Verizon's 5G network will be limited to a few cities, including Los Angeles, Houston, Sacramento, and a city that has yet to be announced, when the 5G Moto Mod is released in early 2019.

Apple phones generally offer better apps and a better owner experience than their Android rivals, and the iPhone 7 is no different. The support you get from Apple if something goes wrong is superior to what you get from Android device makers. And unlike on most Android phones, with iPhones you can always get the latest software updates straight from Apple as soon as it releases them.   The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus offer some compelling features, including water-resistant cases, great cameras that perform well in low light, and a powerful processor. The phones also work well with other Apple products, including the company's wireless AirPods headphones.   The iPhone 7 Plus' dual-lens camera system is its distinguishing feature. It allows you to take pictures with a professional-looking ""bokeh"" effect, which blurs the background behind your subject. Additionally, the system allows you to zoom in on your subjects; its second camera offers a 2x optical zoom.   Unlike the digital zoom feature found in other cameras, an optical zoom allows you to enlarge an image of your subject without sacrificing picture quality.  iPhone 7 price: $550 iPhone 7 Plus price: $670 Check out the iPhone 7 review Â»  The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are ""old"" phones now that the S9 is released, but Samsung is still selling them for a nice little discount.

The Phone can refresh its screen 120 times a second; most phones, by comparison only refresh their screens 60 times a second. The Phone's faster refresh rate allows it to offer super smooth gameplay.   But the Phone doesn't just use the feature to make games look good. The refresh rate also affects the way it displays apps and its Android interface. It works beautifully; everything you do on the phone is ultra smooth in a way never seen before on a smartphone. In fact, Razer may have set the standard for how all phone displays should work — not just those on gaming devices.   But there's more to the Phone than just its screen. It's also got an eye-catching industrial design that stands out when compared with the sleek and svelte designs of most other Android phones.   The large borders above and below the Phone's screen may look out of step with the borderless designs of other recent phones. But hiding beneath those borders are the loudest and best speakers we've heard on any smartphone.

Just note that it doesn't work on Verizon's network.  Price: $800  The Mate 10 Pro is the most enticing one to date that the Chinese company has offered in the US market. It features a nice, if somewhat generic, design; water resistance; a large, 4,000mAh battery; and a dual-lens camera system.   It also runs on a Kirin 970 processor that comes with something called a neural-network processing unit, or NPU. The NPU lets the phone adapt and respond to how you use it. It can adjust the device's power consumption to offer both the best performance and efficiency.   Combined with the Mate 10 Pro's jumbo-sized battery, the NPU allows the device to have insane battery life.  Price:  $540  The LG G7 is a great smartphone that should certainly have a place on your short list. It features everything you could possibly want in a smartphone, including performance, a great camera, and other features like wireless charging and water resistance.   It even has a headphone jack and one of the loudest speakers I've heard on a smartphone. As an LG phone, it also comes with a high quality audio amplifier for the best quality music through headphones compared to most other smartphones.  Price: $750  The Essential Phone is a gorgeous device, and it's been moved up to a better spot on the list for its price tag, design, and the fact that it got the latest Android 9 Pie update at the same time as Google's Pixel phones.   It has a nearly edge-to-edge display and a case made of ultrapremium materials — ceramic on the back and titanium on the sides. It also runs a nearly stock version of Android, which I prefer over the heavily modified versions that Samsung and LG phones tend to use.   Overall, the Phone is a great first effort from Essential. It's speedy and takes great photos. It also has two magnetic pins on its back that serve as a connection point for peripherals, including a 360-degree camera and a wireless-charging dock.   Essential recently dropped the price of the Phone to $500 from $700, and its price can periodically drop even further at times. That's a great deal for a great phone.  Price:  $344 Read the Essential Phone review Â»  The iPhone 8 comes with a refined glass-and-metal case, a superb camera, and strong performance. With it, Apple is finally supporting both wireless and fast charging — features that Android phones have long offered but had been missing from previous iPhones.  Price: $700 Check out the iPhone 8 review Â»  The Pixel 2 might not be the most beautiful Android phone you can buy, but it has a secret weapon that vaults it above most of the competition — it runs the latest and purest version of the operating system at all times. Because it's unadulterated, that version looks and runs better than any of the tweaked takes on Android other phone makers include with their devices.   Better yet, because the Pixel 2's Android is unmodified, you'll be able to install the latest updates as soon as Google rolls them out. That's not something you can usually do with other Android phones. But it's important and, hey, who doesn't want to get the latest version of Android as soon as it's available?   But the Pixel 2 has other features that help put it ahead of other Android devices, including an amazing camera, great performance, and outstanding battery life. And unlike its predecessor, the original Pixel, the Pixel 2 is water-resistant. All told, it's like a smarter —if less attractive — Galaxy phone.  Price: $650 Check out the Pixel 2 review Â»  The Galaxy S9 is a superb smartphone with almost every feature under the sun. It sports the latest specs, best display, one of the best cameras you can get on a smartphone, a gorgeous design, wireless charging, water resistance, and several other features that make the Galaxy S9 a fool-proof buy.   So why doesn't it get the top spot on the list? Other smartphones, including its bigger sibling the Galaxy S9 Plus, come with dual-camera systems. On top of that, Samsung's own version of Android isn't for everyone.  Price: $620 Check out the Galaxy S9 review Â»  The iPhone X is Apple's biggest leap in design and features in years, but it's held back by a massive $1,000 price tag, questionable Face ID performance for unlocking, and the lack of a backup fingerprint scanner.   Face ID might actually work perfectly well for some people, but a minimum of $1,000 for this smartphone doesn't work well for many others. It's just an iPhone with a fancy design and doesn't offer much more than the less expensive iPhone 8 Plus.   Still, it gets a decently high spot on the list for running iOS and being part of Apple's ecosystem, and for its design, screen, and camera.  Price: $1,000  Check out the iPhone X review Â»  The Pixel 2 XL has nearly the same components and features that make the Pixel 2 great, but it comes in a bigger package with a larger display and a fresher-looking design. The Pixel 2 XL isn't the best-looking Android phone, but with the narrow borders around its screen, it looks sleeker and more refined than its smaller sibling or its predecessors from last year.   And the unadulterated Android experience it offers is unbeatable.   Users and reviewers initially reported encountering several problems with the Pixel 2 XL, mostly with its screen. Some reported the colors it displayed weren't as vibrant as those on other top Android phones. Google later issued an update that made colors appear more vibrant.  Price: $850  Check out the Pixel 2 XL review Â»  Starting at $800, the iPhone 8 Plus is essentially the same smartphone as the $1,000 iPhone X. You get the same dual-lens camera and performance. You're only missing out on Face ID, a new design, and the iPhone X's beautiful OLED display. But that still doesn't warrant the iPhone X's price tag. Android devices have had OLED displays for years without going into quadruple digits for the price.   The iPhone 8 Plus has a fingerprint scanner instead of the iPhone X's Face ID, and it's a better phone for it. You don't get the Animoji feature that only works with Face ID, but Animoji aren't exactly an amazing reason to go for the iPhone X over the iPhone 8 Plus.  Price: $800 Check out the iPhone 8 review Â»  The Galaxy Note 9 is the best Android smartphone that Samsung has released. It has a large 6.4 inch display that looks fantastic with Samsung's technology. And combined with its high-powered specs, it's a veritable productivity and multitasking machine. I've also recently come to appreciate the S Pen stylus for taking notes at the spur of a thought and for keeping organized, and it gives me more precision for tasks that I'd usually reserve for a computer.   At $1,000, it's priced for enthusiasts and power users rather than the casual smartphone user. But if you're comparing the Galaxy Note 9 to another $1,000 smartphone — the iPhone X — it's a much better smartphone.  Price:  $1,000  The Galaxy S9 Plus is largely just a bigger version of the regular Galaxy S9, but it has a dual-lens camera system where the secondary lens serves as a 2x optical zoom lens. The Plus model also comes with more RAM than the regular S9, which helps with overall performance speed.   It's my top smartphone pick because it's a clear example that you don't need to spend $1,000 - the price of an iPhone X - to get a top, premium, full-fat smartphone experience. The Galaxy S9 Plus checks off all the boxes and I'd easily recommend it to anyone looking for a new smartphone.  Price:  $740 Check out the Galaxy S9 review Â»  The OnePlus 6 doesn't have wireless charging, an official water resistance rating, the sharpest screen, or the absolute best camera on a smartphone. But for what it offers at its $530 price tag, the OnePlus 6 is the best smartphone value you can buy at the moment. I'd recommend the OnePlus 6 to anyone looking for a new smartphone.   It's the fastest performer of any Android smartphone, it has a beautiful design, it has a great camera, and the company's Dash Charger is the fastest and best charger you can find on any smartphone.   The OnePlus 6 also runs a near-stock version of Android with the company's Oxygen OS. I'll always prefer the clean, stock look of Android rather than the Android operating system you'll see on phones from Samsung, HTC, or LG.   The biggest caveat is that it doesn't support Verizon and Sprint.  Price: $530-570  Get the latest Google stock price here.  ",0.024,0.825,0.151,0.9999

The underground auditorium can hold 1,000 attendees, and it's equipped with  hidden walls, a state-of-the-art projection system, and some  very fancy chairs, all under a carbon fiber roof. The entire campus reportedly cost $5 billion to build.   But Apple is merely staking a claim on how the above-ground portion looks — it's a circular building with clear glass walls, and in person, it's reportedly stunning.   Apple filed for the patent in 2016, and lists four inventors, two in Hong Kong and two in San Francisco. It's called ""Building.""   Apple has increasingly tied the glass design and aesthetic of its stores and other real estate to its brand worldwide.

Toyota is investing $500 million in Uber at a $72 billion valuation as part of a self-driving-car partnership. Uber's tech will be integrated into custom-built Toyota vehicles set to be used for a network of self-driving cars, with the first pilots scheduled for 2021.  2.  Some Apple insiders are referring to 2018 as an iPhone ""S"" year, referring to Apple's old system of introducing a new phone design one year and then speed upgrades — the S year — the next. According to Bloomberg, Apple could launch three new iPhones this year, all sporting a screen that covers the entire front of the device.  3.  Marketers are poring over legal documents to make sure they don't screw up using data on Facebook. Facebook is shutting down its Partner Categories ad program and replacing it with Custom Audiences, which will still allow third parties to work with brands in building audiences — but puts the data-protection onus on marketers.  4.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk started having second thoughts about taking his company private when advisers began lining up big-name investors, like rival car firms. According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk also regretted losing the small-fry shareholders who had been his biggest champions.  5.  Facebook barred Myanmar's top army official for ""serious human rights abuses"" as it tries to atone for its role in spreading misinformation in the country. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing is among the 20 Myanmarese and organizations now barred from Facebook.  6.  Officials identified the gamers Elijah Clayton and Taylor Robertson as the two people who died in the shooting at a ""Madden"" tournament in Jacksonville, Florida. The gaming community rallied on social media to pay tribute to the victims.  7.  Tinder's cofounder Sean Rad said he had ""no choice"" but to sell his stock in the dating-app maker a month before he left the company. According to The Verge, Rad was fired from Tinder's parent firm and would have lost the chance to exercise his options within 30 days.  8.  Microsoft introduced an ambitious subscription plan that makes the Xbox the best deal in gaming. The Xbox All Access plan starts at $22 a month for US players, giving subscribers an Xbox One console, two years of Xbox Live Gold service, and two years of Xbox Game Pass.  9.

Apple has released new iPhones every September since 2012.

The Kuo research corroborates a  report from Bloomberg on Monday— but it also includes some new predictions, including his belief that none of the new iPhones will support Apple Pencil, the company's stylus.   He also believes that a new iPhone model, expected to sport a 6.1-inch LCD screen — with more viewing area than an iPhone 8 Plus — might launch later than the two more traditionally-sized iPhone models the company is cooking up.   ""Two new OLED iPhone models will be available in September, and the new 6.1"" LCD iPhone model will be available slightly later due to its later production schedule,"" he wrote in the note, predicting the 6.1-inch model could account for 50-55% of iPhone shipments during the next cycle.   Kuo's research notes focus on the supply chain, with an audience of for Asian investors who are looking to invest in the companies that sell iPhone, iPad, and Mac parts to Apple. He writes that now is the best time to invest in Apple's suppliers, and he recommends buying shares in companies including Luxshare, O-film, Catcher, and others.

There have been plenty of  accounts over the years that have detailed his cruelty, rudeness, and miserliness to workers, business partners, and even family and friends.   Still, the  stories that have come out so far from ""Small Fry,"" the new autobiography from his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs, are shocking. Jobs comes across not just as someone who could be self-centered and mean but as  someone who was a truly terrible human being.   We've known for years that Jobs initially denied being Brennan-Jobs' father and didn't start paying child support until after a DNA test proved he was and a court ordered him to start paying. We've also known that he denied for years that Apple's Lisa computer, which debuted right before the Macintosh, was named for his daughter — before finally acknowledging it to her and the world.   But Brennan-Jobs' book adds fresh details. He  rarely saw her when she was a young child, she says, even after admitting his paternity. While he was avoiding her and avoiding paying child support — despite already having founded and been making money at Apple — she and her mother lived in poverty, subsisting on welfare payments, her mother's low-paying jobs, and the charity of others. When he was finally forced to pay child support, he made sure that the case against him was closed days before Apple went public and he became a multimillionaire.   Even after Jobs started paying more attention to Brennan-Jobs, her mother, Chrisann Brennan, apparently felt uncomfortable leaving him with her alone after an incident in which he was said to have questioned and teased the then-9-year-old Brennan-Jobs about her sexual attractions and proclivities.   Then, when Brennan-Jobs went to live with him as a teenager, she says, he forbade her from seeing Brennan for six months, even though her mother had been the only constant figure in her life up to then. After moving in with them, Brennan-Jobs told him and her stepmother, Laurene Powell Jobs, that she felt lonely and asked that they tell her goodnight in the evenings. Instead of acknowledging her feelings and acceding to such a simple request, Powell Jobs apparently  responded, ""We're cold people."" ""Small Fry"" indicates that Laurene Powell Jobs, pictured, enabled Jobs' cruelty to his daughter.                                            Steve Jennings / Stringer / Getty Images                                    But there's more. Once, she says, as Jobs groped his wife and pretended to be having sex with her, he demanded that Brennan-Jobs stay in the room, calling it a ""family moment."" He repeatedly withheld money from her, told her that she would get ""nothing"" from his wealth — and even refused to install heat in her bedroom.   When she started to become active in her high school, getting involved in clubs and running for student government, Jobs — the one, again, who previously refused to acknowledge his paternity and spent almost no time with her when she was little — apparently got on Brennan-Jobs for not spending more time with the family, telling her: ""This isn't working out. You're not succeeding as a member of this family.""   At one point, neighbors of the family were so worried about Brennan-Jobs that they helped her move into their house. They also helped her pay for college.   It's bad to treat employees and significant others poorly. But it's really evil to inflict such pain on a child. We knew Jobs was a bully toward many people. Now, it seems, we know he was one to his own daughter.   These are only excerpts from the book, which goes on sale September 4, so we don't have the full picture. And of course, they're the recollections of one person, with all the emotional baggage and bias that entails. Powell Jobs and Jobs' sister have said in a statement that the book ""differs dramatically from our memories of those times.""   ""The portrayal of Steve is not the husband and father we knew,"" they said in their statement. ""Steve loved Lisa, and he regretted that he was not the father he should have been during her early childhood.""   In her book, Brennan-Jobs brings up these incidents not to condemn Jobs but to make peace with them and him. She aims to forgive him and move on.                                                                                                                       That's her choice and her right. But, as others have pointed out, what she endured was something many people would now consider child abuse — the intentional infliction of emotional cruelty. And in trying to find a way to forgive and understand him, she is reacting similarly to other survivors.    In trying to find a way to excuse her father, Brennan-Jobs is following a long line of people, all of whom are much more culpable than her for his behavior. Generally, the only way to get a bully to back off is to stand up to him and for others to do so on behalf of his targets; in Jobs' case, too few people did.   When it concerned his behavior toward Brennan-Jobs, his wife, Powell Jobs, clearly didn't stand up to him. When it concerned his behavior toward employees and business partners, his colleagues just as obviously didn't.   I don't know how the cosmic balancing stick weighs something as complicated as a person's life, but I do think Brennan-Jobs' book puts the other stories about Jobs, the ones about how he treated his employees, colleagues, and partners, in a different light. They make him seem less like a driven leader who was sometimes harsh to achieve his goals and more like a cruel person who succeeded because those around him accommodated and acquiesced to his awfulness.                                                                                                                       Jobs is rightly praised for his role in resurrecting Apple. When he took charge, the company was a few months away from bankruptcy. When he left Apple right before his death, it already was the most important consumer-technology company in the world and was well on its way to becoming the behemoth it is now. Given the generally poor track record of corporate managers in turning around seemingly hopeless situations, it's quite possible that only Jobs could have saved Apple and put it on that path.   And that's no small achievement. In turning around the company, Jobs saved thousands of jobs and helped to create thousands more. He also made lots of people inside and outside the company very rich.   The positive side of Jobs' ledger also includes his role in creating some of the most influential products of the past 50 years — the iPhone, the Mac, the iPad, the iPod, and the original Apple computers. Maybe similar products could and would have been created without him. But there's no denying that he had a leading role in shaping how billions of people interact with technology, in many ways for the better.   Of course even those achievements are leavened by less laudable ones, such as his overseeing of Apple's outsourcing of thousands of factory jobs overseas and the convoluted contortions the company made to avoid paying taxes. He also headed the company and personally benefited when it backdated stock options to make them more valuable but let other executives take the fall. Oh, and he repeatedly yelled at employees and publicly embarrassed them.   And that's not to mention his antics during his first tenure at Apple, such as how he attempted to undermine then-CEO John Sculley and  refused to give stock options to one of Apple's earliest employees.                                                                                                                       In the end, did his business achievements outweigh the cruelty he inflicted on others? I don't know.   I do know that we too often glorify business leaders for their achievements without taking a close look at who they are as human beings and how their actions — both personal and professional — affect those around them and the wider world. I also believe that focus on their accomplishments helps enable their bad behavior.   That certainly seemed to be the case with Steve Jobs.   This is an opinion column.

A fully functioning Apple-1 being auctioned by Boston-based RR Auction in September is one of only 60 or so remaining of the original 200 that were designed and built by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976 and 1977.   It was restored to its original, operational state by Apple expert Corey Cohen. The system was operated without fault for approximately eight hours in a test. It even includes the original keyboard from the 1970s.   It shows the humble beginnings of Cupertino, California-based Apple, which recently became the world's first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion.   The Apple 1 originally sold for about $666. It could get $300,000 or more at auction.   ",0.021,0.875,0.104,0.8611

If she were in charge, Brennan-Jobs would donate Steve Jobs' money to the  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, she  told The New York Times while discussing her upcoming memoir, ""Small Fry.""   The statement may seem surprising in light of Apple's longstanding rivalry with Bill Gates' Microsoft. But Brennan-Jobs said she was impressed with the Gates Foundation, which  has spent billions to fund work in education, emergency relief, and global health, among other issues.   ""Would it be too perverse?"" she told The Times. ""I feel like the Gates Foundation is really doing good stuff, and I think I would just hot potato it away.""   Brennan-Jobs intended her memoir to be a nuanced depiction of her family, though she fears readers will focus too much on the moments Jobs  was vicious to her, according to The Times. Some details in the book  paint a damning picture, including anecdotes about Jobs refusing to install heat in Brennan-Jobs' bedroom, forgetting her birthday, and saying she smelled ""like a toilet.""   Powell Jobs, her children, and Jobs' sister told The Times that Brennan-Jobs' book ""differs dramatically"" from their memories of the Apple founder.   In his will, Jobs left his fortune to Powell Jobs, who runs the philanthropic organization Emerson Collective. Over the past few years, Emerson  has purchased a majority stake in The Atlantic, received a $10 million donation from the Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant to expand the College Track program (which supports students through college), and  committed $50 million to her XQ project for rethinking high schools.   Powell Jobs also bought the second-largest stake in a holding company that owns the NBA's Washington Wizards, the NHL's Washington Capitals, and more.   Emerson was set up as a limited liability company, meaning it is not required to reveal details about its spending and assets. The Gates Foundation's setup, meanwhile, entails detailed annual reports and greater transparency in spending.   ",0.054,0.869,0.077,0.7893

Reuters                                      Dozens of prominent CEOs have sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen denouncing several recent changes to immigration policies that they say have stoked fear among their employees and could ultimately harm US businesses.   The letter named 60 executives — including Apple's Tim Cook, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, Salesforce's Marc Benioff, PepsiCo's Indra Nooyi, BlackRock's Larry Fink, and IBM's Ginni Rometty — and warned the Trump administration that its policies will prompt highly skilled immigrants to take their talents elsewhere.   ""As the federal government undertakes its legitimate review of immigration rules, it must avoid making changes that disrupt the lives of thousands of law-abiding and skilled employees, and that inflict substantial harm on US competitiveness,"" the letter read.   Over the last year and a half, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, agency has implemented a host of changes to the country's legal immigration system that, in many cases, make it more difficult to apply for or renew work visas, or obtain a green card.   The CEOs pointed to several key changes they said were negatively affecting thousands of employees:  Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Monday, June 4, 2018, in San Jose, Calif.                                            Associated Press/Marcio Jose Sanchez                                    The CEOs noted that many of the employees affected by these changes have not only worked in the US for years and followed US immigration laws, but they possess valuable skills that cannot easily be found among American workers.   ""At a time when the number of job vacancies are reaching historic highs due to labor shortages, now is not the time restrict access to talent,"" the letter said.   USCIS has defended many of the policy changes by arguing they ""protect the interests of United States workers"" or ""discourage frivolous or substantially incomplete"" applications.   But the agency has come under fire previously for what some perceived as hostility towards legal immigrants. USCIS Director Lee Francis Cissna stoked controversy in February when he dropped the term ""nation of immigrants"" from the agency's mission statement.   ""Who does the agency serve? I think there's been a misunderstanding of that one the years,"" Cissna said last week.

Comedy Dynamics                                      Jim Gaffigan's latest stand-up special, ""Noble Ape,"" features some of the strongest material of the comedian's career. In part, he recounts with moving and dark humor the plight of his wife and cowriter, Jeannie Gaffigan, who last year underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor.   But Gaffigan's unorthodox distribution of ""Noble Ape"" is nearly as notable as the comedy it contains.   With five of his stand-up specials already on Netflix, Gaffigan opted to follow the suggestion of his longtime producer, Comedy Dynamics founder Brian Volk-Weiss, who proposed that Gaffigan release his sixth special simultaneously for purchase and renting on a wide variety of services like Apple TV, Amazon, Spotify, and numerous other on-demand outlets.   In July, the expansive release ran through the distribution arm of Volk-Weiss's company, which also gave the special a limited theatrical run.   In a phone interview with Business Insider, Gaffigan discussed the distribution of ""Noble Ape"" and the process of working on its ""cathartic"" material with his wife (who directed the special), as well his experiences of touring the world for his act.  John Lynch: Could you take me through how you landed on the distribution model for this special? Jim Gaffigan: Every special that I've released, I've looked at what was the best opportunity to get that special viewed or listened to by as many people as possible. For my first special, ""Beyond the Pale,"" Comedy Central was the perfect destination for it. That was a time before streaming, at the peak of Comedy Central, so ""Beyond the Pale"" and ""King Baby"" were perfect for that. Comedy Central was on in every dorm room. By the time I got to ""Mr. Universe"" and ""Obsessed,"" I looked at what the best opportunity was, and with those, one was released on my website, when that was a thing that people were actively participating in. Then I got to the point with ""Cinco"" where it was sold directly to Netflix. Now, Netflix also ended up purchasing the rights to my specials to stream on their service.   When I had ""Noble Ape,"" I was like, ""All right, I have five specials on Netflix."" I had received offers from the usual suspects, and I was approached by Comedy Dynamics, proposing that the special would be available everywhere people rent or buy. So I wasn't sure exactly how that was going to work, but they explained that people consume things in a different manner. Some people consume things on-demand. Some people watch it on Amazon Prime. Some people watch it on Apple TV. Some people listen to it on Spotify. So their model — you know, obviously they offered me good money — but their model made it available to everyone. You didn't just have to have Netflix. And I thought this was appealing, that it'd be available to everyone at the same time.  Lynch: Several weeks out from the release now, how are you gauging the success of it? Gaffigan: From what I'm hearing from Comedy Dynamics, it's doing amazing. The way the distribution is set up, they gave me a lump sum, and after that we split the profits. But I more measure the success of it on people gaining access to it. I mean, this is a very personal special. It's discussing my wife's brain tumor and all of that. I would say that it's been great, but it's weird, you know, how the landscape changes all the time. From feedback on social media, it's gangbusters. Do you know what I mean? I've never used that term before.  Lynch: (laughs) Yeah. You know, I saw it at the Village East theater here in Manhattan. Given that it was in select theaters, I imagine that wasn't a huge overall factor in the release. But was it at all important to you to have it in theaters, or how did you think of that aspect of it? Gaffigan: That was something that Comedy Dynamics pursued. It was not something I had an expectation of. With previous specials, when you're kind of approached with options, that's one scenario. Comedians have released specials in theaters. But I was thrilled about the theatrical release, even though it was small, just because it was a further example of it being everywhere you watch and rent.   Lynch: Seeing it in theaters, you do open with this very cinematic, BuÃ±uel-esque surrealist scene, depicting the horrors of brain surgery but also the dark comedy of that situation. How was it for your wife to direct that opening and the special itself? Gaffigan: You know, it's interesting. That whole opening was my wife's idea. It was something that she wanted to do. The timing of us shooting it, because I was working on a couple movies, made it so that it was only available in the theatrical release, and I think it's been added as an extra feature on iTunes. But that was all Jeannie's idea. Obviously, my wife and I, we write everything together. She was instrumental in some of the material on her brain tumor, but that opening was all her. It was interesting, and my five-year-old, he was like, ""It's too scary."" The opening's too scary for him.  Lynch: What was your experience generally of incorporating this really personal material with some of the more traditional stuff that you do? How was it working with the mix of that? Gaffigan: Look, as a comedian, it's incredibly cathartic to process life events into material. It kind of helps organize them, and it pays homage to the feelings or fears you might have been experiencing. But I also think that's how I process life is through jokes, and same with my wife. My wife came out of a two-hour MRI, and she was like, ""Write this down,"" like she had ideas from the MRI. It just kind of happens in certain ways.  Lynch: In the second half of the special, you sort of take us on a tour describing your touring abroad. You joke about difficulties with social mores in China, Japan, England. I'm wondering, is there any country or area in the world that you've found harder to perform in than others? Gaffigan: Well, some of doing stand-up in other countries is — it's not ideal, but that's almost what I enjoy about it. First of all, you're subjected to a completely different set of social norms, and you typically have a language difference. But those obstacles, they provide fodder for material. I did a show in Barcelona, and I only got to spend a day or two in Barcelona, but it prompts you to absorb. And some of it may be initial observation. I'm sorry, I don't know if I'm even answering your question.                                                                                                                                  Lynch: (laughs) No yeah, it's all good. Gaffigan: But yeah, I love the international shows because I'm somebody who loves traveling internationally, and I love different cultures. You're forced to have a completely different point-of-view, and it also gives you insight into your own culture. You know, Paris is a beautiful city, but I think famous writers have written in Paris because they can gain a perspective on America just by being in another country.  Lynch: How would you say your years of touring informed this special in particular? Gaffigan: I would say, doing stand-up for as long as I have, you develop a skill set. Any comedian would tell you you should be able to make everything funny, and doing stand-up for that long, whether it be a medical crisis or traveling through another country, those same skills that I use to make food or laziness funny, I can apply those same skills to what it's like to be an American in another country or what it's like to have a spouse have this life-threatening medical emergency.   Lynch: Going back to the distribution briefly, the path you took for ""Noble Ape,"" do you see that as a viable option for other comedians, or as something you'll see people adopt? Gaffigan: What I've learned from doing stand-up and releasing six specials now is that the landscape changes relatively dramatically every couple years. There was a time when having a special Comedy Central seemed like the only logical step to take, or releasing a special on Netflix seemed like the only logical step. But the marketplace is ever-changing. By the way, Netflix is great for stand-up. I love Netflix. Netflix has five specials of mine. If I didn't have five specials on Netflix, I might have taken a different approach. But every couple years, the technology and market changes. When I started stand-up, there was no YouTube. Comedy Central was just like a clumsy cable network that did comedy. I mean, I'm thrilled that people are enjoying this special, and I'm thrilled that Comedy Dynamics views the special as a success. Comedian friends have expressed excitement that there's an alternative in distribution, but I also know that we live in an age where, in a year, Amazon, or Apple, or who knows, Disney, could get into the comedy business, because comedy specials are relatively inexpensive to produce.   What I've found with my material, and one of the things that was also appealing, is an audio version being released simultaneously, because a lot of people consume my comedy while driving in a car. Some distribution models, understandably, they want it exclusively to say, HBO, or Showtime, or Netflix. They don't want the audio version released right away. But in ten or fifteen years, with the audio version of a stand-up special as an album, I think people kind of underestimate the popularity of that, because we're living in this age where audio streaming services are really rising out of nowhere.  Lynch: Moving forward for you, what's next? I know you've also been in a couple films this year, but what's on deck for you career-wise? Gaffigan: I love acting, and given the right opportunity, I would love to do tons of acting in film. But the thing that's great about stand-up is you don't have to wait for the opportunity. You can be writing and working whenever you want. Obviously, living in New York City, it's helpful to be able to walk over to a club and try out material. I love acting and I love stand-up, but no matter what I do, I'll always be doing stand-up. Creating specials is something that I really enjoy.  ""Noble Ape"" is available now on on-demand services like Apple TV, Amazon, iTunes, and more.  ",0.033,0.764,0.203,0.9999

In 2017,  he called the fees the firms charge app developers ""parasitic"" — and earlier this month took the unprecedented step of deciding to release ""Fortnite"" on Android independently of Google's app store, sidestepping the fees altogether.   This may be only the tip of the iceberg.   For as long as Google and Apple have operated app stores for their mobile operating systems — the Google Play Store on Android and the App Store on iOS — the two Silicon Valley giants have charged a hefty 30% on all transactions, whether on initial app purchases or in-app sales. (For subscription services, in some circumstances, they now charge 15%.)   These fees have long been considered a cost of doing business in the world of apps — but according to a recent research note from analysts at the financial services and research company Macquarie Research, the game industry is growing increasingly fed up.   ""Given our coverage of the video game industry, we've had behind closed door discussions with game developers who claim that [Apple's] and [Google's] commission structure is unfair and that they may take a more public role in pushing back against the business model,"" the analysts wrote in a note.   ""We've also heard directly from the CEO of a major game publisher that 'Apple is a monopoly' that is taking way too big of a cut. As [Google] and [Apple] continue to add more services and directly compete with app developers, we suspect some of these voices from the music, video, game business, and others may become louder.""   In other words: Games companies are privately griping about the problem, and more and more are thinking about finally going public with their concerns — a radical move that could inflame the debate around the appropriateness of the two companies' fees to a level not seen in years. (Outside the games industry,  Netflix is now also experimenting with a way to avoid app-store fees.)   Google and Apple did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.   There are limits to what games companies can do short term, of course. For consumers, the process of sidestepping Google's Play Store to get apps is technical and requires users to change settings on their phone, potentially compromising their security — something users would arguably be less inclined to do for anything other than the megahit that is ""Fortnite.""                                                                                                           And on Apple's iOS such a maneuver simply isn't possible: The operating system is locked down, with no way in for developers other than the App Store. It's Apple's way or the highway.   But a very public display of displeasure could still put pressure on Google and Apple to make concessions, in an era of extreme sensitivity around tech companies' public images amid increased dissatisfaction with the industry from regulators, lawmakers, and the general public.   If app publishers do win concessions, it could be a bonanza for games companies.   Macquarie calculates that King, a mobile games publisher owned by Activision Blizzard, would see a 12% boost to its EBIT, a measure of profitability, in 2020 if the fees were cut to 15%. EA's 2021 EBIT would surge 8%. And Zynga's 2020 EBIT would soar 53%.   These are multibillion-dollar companies — meaning a whole lot of money is potentially up for grabs. But Facebook and Google are unlikely to give up easily either;  they risk losing billions of dollars from a reduction in fees.

""We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard.' If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I'm not kidding,"" Musk told German newspaper  Handelsblatt in 2015.   These days, it seems like there is an increasing number of headstones popping up in Cupertino, California.   CNBC reports that Apple is on a hiring spree, poaching ""scores"" of ex-Tesla employees for a variety of projects, citing better pay at the iPhone giant.   A Tesla spokesperson seemed to say that was the reason for the attrition, too, in a statement to CNBC:   ""We wish them well. Tesla is the hard path. We have 100 times less money than Apple, so of course they can afford to pay more. We are in extremely difficult battles against entrenched auto companies that make 100 times more cars than we did last year, so of course this is very hard work.""   LinkedIn shows 46 people who jumped from the carmaker to Apple so far this year, and there are more that haven't updated their profile.   One person who hasn't updated his profile is Doug Field, a high-powered executive who oversaw engineering for the Tesla Model 3. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year he planned to take a ""six-week sabbatical.""   In August, it came out that he took a job at Apple, returning to the company he had worked before Tesla. Field is said to now be working on Project Titan, Apple's car project. Apple has a team of at least hundreds working on autonomous vehicles, with  test vehicles driving on California streets today.

Brennan-Jobs is the daughter of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. After spending her early years with her mother, artist Chrisann Brennan, Brennan-Jobs went to live with her famous father as a teenager.   While in high school, Brennan-Jobs got into journalism and became the editor-in-chief of her school's newspaper. Her journalism teacher, who was also her mentor, was Esther Wojcicki.   If that last name sounds familiar, it's because it should. That's because she's the mother of Susan and Anne Wojcicki.   Susan Wojcicki, of course, is the CEO of YouTube, and it was in her garage that Larry Page and Sergey Brin first got Google up and running. Anne Wojcicki is the CEO of genomics company 23andMe, and was once married to Brin.   To be sure, Esther Wojcicki is notable in her own right. She's a well-respected educator who has taught journalism at Palo Alto High School for more than two decades and founded the school's Media Arts Center.   In an  interview with The New York Times, Wojcicki praised her former student's new book.   ""The dialogue that she had in there between her and Steve was just exactly right,"" Wojcicki said.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images                                      Lisa Brennan-Jobs, the daughter of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, has written a memoir about life with her world-famous father — and it sounds absolutely brutal.   Her mother, Chrisann Brennan, who was by that point estranged from Jobs, once reportedly asked the Apple cofounder to buy a house for her and their daughter. Instead, Jobs ""agreed it was nice,"" then bought it for himself and his new partner, Laurene Powell Jobs.   That's  according to The New York Times, which has obtained a copy of the book, ""Small Fry,"" early, and interviewed Brennan-Jobs about her relationship with her father.   Ugly details of the relationship between Jobs and his daughter have been public for years. He once claimed she wasn't his child and refused to pay child support until ordered to. But the book, as detailed in The New York Times' account, provides an unprecedented window into the Jobs household as Brennan-Jobs grew up, including some disturbing parenting practices by the legendary entrepreneur.   Brennan-Jobs, however, does not want the account to be condemnatory, and stressed to the paper that she has forgiven her father and wishes to emphasize his better side. ""Have I failed in fully representing the dearness and the pleasure? The dearness of my father, and the outrageous pleasure of being with him when he was in good form?"" she reportedly said.   Even so, the details described are alarming. In one incident, Jobs reportedly refused to put heating in Brennan-Jobs' bedroom to give her a ""value system.""   Another time, Jobs seems to have behaved inappropriately in front of his daughter with Powell Jobs. The New York Times wrote:   Ms. Brennan-Jobs describes him embracing Ms. Powell Jobs one day, 'pulling her in to a kiss, moving his hand closer to her breasts,' and up her thigh, 'moaning theatrically.'   When Ms. Brennan-Jobs tries to leave, her father stops her: ''Hey Lis,' he said. 'Stay here. We're having a family moment. It's important that you try to be part of this family.' I sat still, looking away as he moaned and undulated.'""  An older photo of Lisa Brennan-Jobs.Wikimedia Commons  An  extract previously published in Vanity Fair went into more detail about the alienation Brennan-Jobs, now 40, felt from her father growing up. ""I see now that we were at cross-purposes. For him, I was a blot on a spectacular ascent, as our story did not fit with the narrative of greatness and virtue he might have wanted for himself,"" she wrote.                                                                                               ""My existence ruined his streak. For me, it was the opposite: the closer I was to him, the less I would feel ashamed; he was part of the world, and he would accelerate me into the light.""   At one point she had overheard her mother say that Jobs bought a new Porsche every time he scratched one, and later asked him if she could have one ""when you're done.""   His response was biting: ""You're not getting anything ... You understand? Nothing. You're getting nothing."" (Brennan-Jobs did ultimately receive an inheritance.)   In a statement, Powell Jobs and Jobs' sister Mona Simpson said: ""Lisa is part of our family, so it was with sadness that we read her book, which differs dramatically from our memories of those times. The portrayal of Steve is not the husband and father we knew. Steve loved Lisa, and he regretted that he was not the father he should have been during her early childhood. It was a great comfort to Steve to have Lisa home with all of us during the last days of his life, and we are all grateful for the years we spent together as a family.""  Got a tip?

As a person who has used and paid for storage through Apple's iCloud, Dropbox and Google Drive for an extended period — at one point, simultaneously — I've identified all their strengths and quirks so you don't have to.  Overall, I've found Google Drive to be the most versatile, affordable solution of the three, as well as the easiest to use. Here's why:  If you use an iPhone or other Apple device, you likely already have an iCloud account. As all Apple customers will know, the company highly encourages users to back up their photos, apps, contacts and all other data in the iCloud.   The first 5 GB of data are free, which is perfect if you're just looking to offload a few photo albums from your phone.   For the more serious storage users, 50 GB will cost you $0.99 a month, 200 GB costs $2.99, and you can get two terabytes of iCloud storage for $9.99 a month.   A basic Dropbox account is free, but includes a measly 2 GB of storage.   The next tier up is Dropbox Pro, which includes a terabyte of space and additional features like offline file viewing for $9.99 a month.   The Dropbox Professional tier comes with 2 TB and extras like full-text keyword search for $19.99.   Larger business-tier plans are available based on the size of the company and its needs.   Google Drive is one of the many free apps that come with a Google account, and acts as the storage source for all files you create through Google Docs, Excel and Slides, along with any files from your hard drive that you might want to back up on the cloud, like vacation photos, home videos, or important documents.   Google Drive offers 15 free gigabytes of storage, before asking you to pay.   The paid tiers begin at $1.99 a month for 100 GB, which is likely more than enough for the average person, who is simply looking to backup their phone.   Students, photographers and other people who have more files than the average person will be happy to hear Google also offers two terabytes of storage for $9.99 a month and 10 terabytes for $99.99 a month.   After that, users can get 20 terabytes for $200 a month, 30 terabytes for $300 a month, and so on.   The versatility is a nice perk, because it allows you to take your file backups wherever you go, and access them from a new device with a simple login.   That said, the Google Drive app has a minor quirk: While the app serves as a home to your Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, those files cannot be edited from inside the mobile app. If you want to make changes to a spreadsheet on the go, you'll need to also download the separate Google Sheets app.   Dropbox's site and app have a very impersonal, often counter-intuitive layout, which I've found to be more challenging to navigate than the other options, especially for newcomers.   With sorting tools on the left, and the upload and organization controls on the right, the layout seems unorganized and confusing. In addition, so many of the software's most powerful features are hidden by unclear labeling.   In my own experience, I've found Dropbox's interface too complex and frustrating to really unlock its full potential.   After logging in, iCloud users are greeted with a simple directory of every app that contains data saved to the cloud.   Clicking any app will reveal your stored files, in a browser-adapted version of the classic OS apps. Obviously, this is much more convenient for iPhone and Mac computer users than it would be for Android users, who will be much less familiar with the lay of the Apple-land.   Miscellaneous files that can't be placed within Apple's own apps like Pages and Numbers can be found in the ""iCloud Drive"" folder seen above.    More info available here.   Beyond its eye-pleasing aesthetic, the ""Quick Access"" section and customizable features make Google Drive the most dynamic and reliably painless among the three cloud-storage apps.   Even in times when I've forgotten to rename or neglected to organize my files within my Google Drive, the approachable homepage and intuitive tools have prevented me from ever losing track of a file I needed to pull up quickly.   Dropbox lets users upload contacts for those who often share with the same people consistently— all you need to share a file or folder of files with a friend is their email address.   The owner of a file can decide who has view-only access or will be able to edit, download, or delete their files.   Dropbox can also create a link to the file, which the user can easily copy and paste in a quick message, or post for lots of people to see.   Let's say I want to share a folder of vacation photos with everyone in my family's group chat on iMessage. Rather than adding all of my family members' emails into Dropbox, I can simply copy and paste a link in our group chat, and give everyone access that way.   Users can also customize their link settings, such as choosing to have the link expire after a set period of time, or require a password to see the files.   I've found the comment tool is especially helpful for getting feedback on written documents, because it lets the commenter highlight text and post in-line notes, without actually being able to edit your copy without your knowledge.   The great pricing, versatility of access, and compatibility with other Google apps have all played a part in my recent decision to consolidate my cloud storage solutions, and bring all of my files to Google Drive.   Obviously, your cloud storage needs may be different than mine. iPhone users who like to keep their data protected and embedded within the Apple ecosystem are likely to find more ease by embracing iCloud, and those who are looking to share and upload in large volumes may prefer to invest in a deeper, dedicated solution like Dropbox.   However, Google Drive offers a comprehensive service that will be virtually painless for most people.   Get the latest Google stock price here.  ",0.028,0.831,0.141,0.9991

However, the deal sheds light on two important trends in the OTT space:   Apple is restricting its $1 billion video budget to extremely high-quality content, for now. Apple's video service already has a stellar line-up of mega-stars including Oprah Winfrey, J.J. Abrams, and Steven Spielberg.   The NYT's climate change piece was put together in over a year with help from the Pulitzer Center, and includes over 100 original interviews — which speaks to the high caliber of the journalistic content Apple wants to acquire to transform into video.   It also highlights how publishers are increasingly pitching their video and journalism assets to OTT video streamers.Just this week, millennial-focused digital news publisher Mic announced it's  ramping up production of long-form video projects that it can sell or license to streaming video platforms, starting with Facebook Watch, per Digiday.   In addition, CNN and Conde Nast have scored deals with Netflix, and Vice is on HBO. We'll likely see more and more publishers pitching shows — long- and short-form, to video platforms.

AP                                      The world was a very different place 10 years ago.   A decade ago, you couldn't order an Uber on your phone. You couldn't surf the web on Google Chrome. You couldn't rent a place to stay on demand with Airbnb.   Several incredible products and services have been invented in the last 10 years — some, in the last five or eight. Thanks to a tweet from Button cofounder Chris Maddern, we were inspired to look into some of the cool, convenient things the tech world has invented since 2008.  Take a look.  When Steve Jobs introduced the iPad eight years ago, he described it was ""the best browsing experience you'll ever have.""   ""It's unbelievably great. Way better than a laptop, way better than a smartphone,"" Jobs said on stage in January 2010.   The original iPad cost between $499 and $829. Since then, the device has gone through several iterations and several price points — most recently, Apple unveiled a new $329, 9.7-inch iPad.   Google unveiled its Chrome browser on September 1, 2008.   ""On the surface, we designed a browser window that is streamlined and simple,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai (who was vice president of product management at the time) wrote on the official Google blog.   ""Like the classic Google homepage, Google Chrome is clean and fast,"" Pichai wrote. ""It gets out of your way and gets you where you want to go.""   Snapchat first launched on the App Store in the summer 2011 as a messaging app for sending disappearing photos. At the time, it was called Pictaboo, but it had the same now-famous ghost icon, Ghostface Chillah.   By September 2011, the name had changed to Snapchat and began to catch on with Los Angeles teens.   Six years later, Snapchat is owned by a $15.8 billion public company, Snap Inc., and has expanded into partnerships with publishers, TV-like shows, hardware products, and augmented reality.   The idea for Airbnb formed in 2007 when cofounder Joe Gebbia sent an email to his roommate, Brian Chesky, suggesting they rent out their apartment to make some extra money. After a few attempts, Air Bed & Breakfast finally launched in 2008 as an online platform for renting out spare room at your place, or for people to easily find and book inexpensive places to stay.   Airbnb is now working toward becoming a more full-service travel brand by offering curated experiences called Trips as well as high-end accommodations.   Nine years after launching, Airbnb is profitable and valued at about $38 billion, making it one of the highest-valued startups in the US.   Spotify launched in October 2008 in Stockholm, Sweden. The pair behind the company, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, came up with the name ""Spotify"" in 2005 when Lorentzon was sleeping on a bare mattress at Ek's apartment.   Spotify launched a public beta in the spring of 2007, but it wasn't until the company signed licensing deals with Sony, Universal, BMG, and more that Spotify officially launched. At first, anyone could buy a premium subscription, but the free version of Spotify was available by invite only.   Nearly a decade later, Spotify has 170 million active users worldwide.   Oculus VR began in a garage in Irvine, California in June 2012. Then-19-year-old Palmer Luckey launched the company on Kickstarter, raising nearly $2.5 million for his virtual reality headset. After raising an additional $16 million in funding, Luckey sold Oculus to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion.   Now, Luckey has left Oculus, but the VR company lives on at Facebook. You can buy an Oculus Rift and Touch for $499, and Facebook announced the $200 Oculus Go headset in 2017.   Stripe, a startup aimed at ""disrupting"" online payments, officially launched in September 2011. Now, companies from Target to the NFL use Stripe's technology to power payments in their websites and apps.    Seven years after launch, Stripe is worth about $9 billion.   Instagram first launched in October 2010 with 25,000 people signing up on the first day. By 2011, Instagram was Apple's iPhone app of the year, and by April 2012, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shelled out $1 billion to buy the company.   Instagram now has 1 billion active users and has branched into direct messaging, has launched a clone of Snapchat Stories that now has more monthly users, and has added live video, face filters, stickers, and more. In June, Instagram launched a long-form video service called IGTV.   Kickstarter, the platform for launching and backing independent companies and products, got its start in April 2009 after cofounder Perry Chen wanted a way to crowdsource the cost of inviting musicians to a jazz fest in New Orleans.   The first-ever product was a Grace Jones t-shirt created by Chen that didn't meet its fundraising goal.   Since then, over 15 million people have backed projects and $3.8 billion has been raised on the site.   GPS certainly wasn't invented in the aughts — it's actually been around since 1978, and available for commercial use since 1993. But it wasn't until 2008 and 2009 that GPS became widely available on phones.   Early Apple fans could use it on the iPhone 3G, and by 2009, the iPhone could handle turn-by-turn navigation (TomTom even offered a $100 app for it).   The same year, Android adopters could get GPS for free: Google created free turn-by-turn navigation software to Android smartphones.    Lyft launched in 2012 as a ride-sharing app. The idea morphed out of Zimride, a company founded by John Zimmer and Logan Greene that offered carpooling for long-distance rides and campus car-sharing programs.   Fast-forward to 2018 and Lyft now says it has 1.4 million drivers in the US and Toronto and is valued at $15.1 billion.   Pinterest, a search and discovery app and virtual ""pinboard,"" was founded in March 2010.   Today, the app has 200 million monthly active users and the company is valued betweb $13 billion and $15 billion. The company plans to go public by mid-2019.   Pinterest is also moving on from basic searching and pinning: The company is experimenting with shopping, machine learning and vision, and camera search both in the app and around the web.    Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey launched Square in October 2010 after a friend of his couldn't make a sale because he couldn't process American Express cards.    Square was conceived as a mobile payments service that could process credit cards with an app and a reader that plugged into smartphones.    These days, Square is a $29 billion public company.   4G networks may seem like a given these days, but they've only been around for about seven years. The networks promised to make the mobile internet much faster and much better and were an upgrade the 3G wireless network.    Sprint's HTC Evo was the first 4G phone by several months — it came out in March 2010, followed by a Samsung model in June of that year. Verizon didn't launch 4G until December 2010, and 4G didn't come to the iPhone until the iPhone 5 in 2012.    Uber was founded in March 2009 as a black-car service called UberCab. Garrett Camp, Oscar Salazar, and Conrad Whelan build the first version, with Travis Kalanick serving as a ""mega adviser"" and later, CEO. Over the years, Uber has expanded to offer peer-to-peer ride-sharing, car-pooling, luxury rides, and more.   While the company has been mired in scandal after scandal in the last several months, Uber remains the world's most valuable startup at about $62 billion and its business is still growing.   Venmo first went online in 2009. The startup originally began as a music startup, but the founders decided to switch to payments after founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail came to visit cofounder Andrew Kortina in New York City for the weekend and forgot his wallet.    Venmo was acquired by Braintree in 2012 for $26.2 million, which in turn sold to PayPal in 2013.    Jan Koum incorporated WhatsApp in 2009 before the app had even been written. He and cofounder Brian Acton decided to make it a messaging app, building the company in a converted warehouse they shared with Evernote.   The app grew organically, particularly in developing countries that relied on SMS texting. WhatsApp caught the attention of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2012 and by 2014, Zuckerberg bought the app for $19 billion.   Founder Stewart Butterfield started working on work chat app Slack in 2012. The first iteration of the app was a web-based massively multiplayer game, but it didn't quite work out. Fast-forward to 2013 and the Slack team knew they had a product on their hands that other companies would actually use.    ""We begged and cajoled our friends at other companies to try it out and give us feedback,"" Butterfield said in an interview with venture capital firm First Round Capital.    Most recently, Slack raised $250 million at a $5.1 billion valuation from SoftBank's Vision Fund, Accel, and other investors.    Get the latest Snap stock price here.  ",0.008,0.899,0.093,0.9988

Drew Angerer/Getty Images                                       The news was first reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed its removal to Business Insider. It's still available from the Google Play store on Android.   Onavo, an Israeli security firm acquired by Facebook in 2013, has long been the source of controversy.   Its flagship app, Onavo Protect, offers users a number of security features, including security alerts and access to a virtual private network (VPN). But it also monitors the apps that users use, reporting the data back to Facebook HQ — something the social network has used to identify competitors early and even prompt acquisitions.   According to the WSJ's report, Apple came to the conclusion that the app broke its new rules on data collection, and told Facebook as much earlier in August.   Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment,  but a company spokesperson told CNBC:   ""We work hard to protect user privacy and data security throughout the Apple ecosystem. With the latest update to our guidelines, we made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a user's device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing and must make it clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used.""   In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""We've always been clear when people download Onavo about the information that is collected and how it is used. As a developer on Apple's platform we follow the rules they've put in place.""   According to previous reports from the Wall Street Journal, Facebook has used Onavo to do everything from  monitoring usage of competing apps like Snapchat to  surfacing up-and-coming apps like videochat app Houseparty, and then cloning its core features.                                                                                               Critics have long held that Facebook doesn't do enough to advertise its ownership of Onavo — you have to scroll all the way to the bottom of its description in smartphone app stores to see that disclosure; something not every would-be user may do. Earlier this year, privacy advocates were upset when the  core Facebook app suggested users download Onavo Protect, without disclosing that relationship. It's been called ""vampiric"" and ""spyware"" by pundits.   A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment as to whether the company will take action on Onavo of its own.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images                                      The goal of successful  companies is not only to satisfy the value they promised to their customers in whatever product or service they're offering, but also to exceed expectations and keep those  customers coming back. Repeat customers who become brand  loyalists are often the golden ticket to success.   Tesla and  Apple are prime examples of great customer retention. Tesla has multiple fan clubs, such as the Tesla Motors Club and the Model 3 Owners Club, and the average American household has more than two Apple products, according to a  CNBC survey from 2017 that polled 800 people.   When a company enjoys a client base of devoted fans, it can generally count on consistent sales.   That is, unless the customers turn against the  brand. Over the past few decades, some companies have suffered severe turns of fortune when their most rabid fans turned against them.   People abandon once-beloved companies for various reasons. A  brand may have a drop in product quality, corruption may come to light, or a company could fail to keep up with cultural trends.   Whatever the reason for the change of heart, when a company's fans turn into foes, some brands never recover.   According to a report issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Martha Stewart was charged with insider trading based on her sale of thousands of shares of  ImClone stock shortly before the company announced a new cancer treatment had been rejected by the FDA in 2001.   Stewart was convicted and hit with a five-month jail term and a $30,000 fine,  ABC News reported. But the financial losses didn't stop there. In 2004, Stewart owned 60% of Martha Stewart Omnimedia. ABC News reported that her company's value dropped 50% after Stewart's insider trading scandal, netting the founder's personal loss at more than $325 million in company holdings.   Today,  Town & Country estimates Stewart's net worth at $300 million, down from about $1 billion in 2000 — though this is likely also a reflection of the decline of the magazine industry as a whole.   In the spring of 2010, a deadly blowout at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig led to one of the worst petroleum spills in history. Nearly 210 million gallons of oil poured into the Gulf of Mexico,  CNN reported.   Then-CEO of BP Tony Hayward drew criticism during the disaster by telling The Today Show, ""I'd like my life back.""   Eleven people and  hundreds (if not thousands) of animals lost their lives to this disaster that BP was responsible for as operator of the oil rig at the time. Hayward later  apologized for the insensitive remark and promised that BP's priority was to restore the lives of people living in the Gulf region.   2018 estimates say the total cost of the spill to BP is expected to reach $65 billion, according to  Reuters.   A study published in 2014 in  Harvard Business Review examined the effects of the spill on BP's sales. The researchers found that initially, sales dropped by 3.6% after the spill, as customers ""punished"" the company for the disaster. However, this effect peaked in August of that year, about four months after the leak began.    Back in the late 20th century, there were hundreds of Ratners jewelry shops spread throughout Great Britain and the US, according to  The Guardian. It was a multimillion-dollar jewelry chain, until Ratners' CEO made a fatal comment about the quality of his company's products.   During a speech at a conference in 1991, Gerald Ratner made a joke that one of his own company's products was ""total crap,"" the  Birmingham Post reported.   A year after the 1991 speech took place, Ratners had shut down 330 locations, fired more than 2,000 employees, and watched its profits plummet, according to the  Independent. Eventually Ratners replaced its founder and changed its name to Signet Group, BBC reported.   In 2016, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo Bank $100 million for illegally opening unauthorized accounts in consumers' names so its employees could meet sales goals and earn bonuses.   The bank also had to pay an additional $85 million in fines to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the City and County of Los Angeles.   The result of the practice was about  two million fraudulent accounts. Consumers were hit with fees on accounts they had never authorized and didn't even know they had.   In the months following the scandal,  Fortune reported that customers opened 35% fewer bank accounts at Wells Fargo and that the company received 42% fewer applications for credit cards as it did at the same time the previous year.   In the gaming world, Electronic Arts, also known as EA, earned two ""Worst Company in America"" titles in 2012 and 2013,  Consumerist reported.   According to  USA Today, EA has a reputation for buying small game companies to get a particular title and then running them out of business.   When EA released an early access of ""Star Wars Battlefront II,"" consumers were unhappy to find out that unlocking popular material required over dozens of hours of playing and pricey in-game purchases.   When the company  responded to players' outrage about the blocked characters on Reddit and defended the decision, the message became the most downvoted comment in the site's history, according to TechCrunch.   After the controversy, the company's stock value plummeted by $3 billion,  The Motley Fool reported. It  more than recovered in the next few months, however.   After a decade of growth that saw Chipotle become one of the most beloved fast-casual chains in America, in 2016, the company suffered its first annual decline in sales since its IPO after an E. coli outbreak the previous year scared away customers, according to  Fortune.   A case of  norovirus at one Chipotle location two years later, as well as reports of rodents at another store, added to the negative press. A March 2018 report by UBS Evidence Labs found that 26% of respondents said that they were eating at Chipotle less because of concerns about food safety, as  Business Insider previously reported.   However, in April 2018,  Chipotle reported an increase in sales under the guidance of a new CEO, Markets Insider reported. In July 2018, the company recorded an additional uptick in sales, which they credited to their new queso recipe and menu price increases,  Business Insider reported.   It hasn't been all smooth sailing for the company this year, however. In late July, 2018, a  Chipotle restaurant in Ohio was temporarily closed after reports of customer food poisoning. It only affected one store, but almost 650 people were sickened, Business Insider reported.   In the spring of 2017, a video went viral showing a security guard forcibly removing a man from an overbooked  United Airlines flight, as Business Insider previously reported.   Dr. David Dao was selected for ""re-accommodation"" but protested,  saying he had patients to see the next morning. He was then dragged from the plane and apparently  injured in the process.   In the days that followed,  CNN reported that the company's value plummeted by approximately $1 billion. According to another  CNN report, many customers took to social media to post images of their chopped-up United Airlines credit cards.   ",0.119,0.785,0.096,-0.9918

In 2013, two years after Cook became CEO, Apple updated his compensation plan to include large chunks of stock that would vest if, over a three year period, Apple outperformed two-thirds of the S&P; 500, an index tracking 500 of the biggest public U.S. companies.   Apple is up 31% in the last 12 months, and it's outperformed 81% of the stocks in the index, according to reports from  Bloomberg and  CNBC. Apple also is the first company with a sustained  $1 trillion valuation, which it achieved earlier this month.   That means Cook is lined up to receive a massive payday: 560,000 shares, the maximum amount possible, worth over $120 million at Wednesday's closing price of $215.05.   If the 57-year-old executive is granted the full amount of shares, it will be the fifth consecutive time he's received the maximum payout.   Cook's unvested shares actually make up the bulk of his  estimated $625 million fortune. He currently owns 878,425 shares of Apple, worth about $188 million.   Cook said in 2015 that he plans to give his entire fortune to charity. On Tuesday, he  donated nearly $5 million in Apple stock to an unspecified charity, according to an SEC filing.

The BBC is currently funded to the tune of Â£3.8 billion ($4.9 billion) by the licence fee, paid by TV-owning British households. Corbyn's plan is to supplement this with what he will call a ""digital licence fee.""   ""In the digital age, we should consider whether a digital licence fee could be a fairer and more effective way to fund the BBC,"" he will tell an audience of the UK's most senior TV and media executives.   ""A digital licence fee, supplementing the existing licence fee, collected from tech giants and Internet Service Providers, who extract huge wealth from our shared digital space, could allow a democratized and more plural BBC to compete far more effectively with the private multinational digital giants like Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook.""

Tech firms and ISPs are unlikely to welcome what would effectively be a tax on their operations in the UK.   Indeed Tech UK, a trade body that represents tech firms in the UK and counts the likes of Apple and Google among its members, immediately trashed the idea. ""It is good to see Mr. Corbyn engaging on these issues, however we need better ideas than just another proposal to tax tech companies,"" it said in a statement.   It's unclear whether the BBC would even welcome such a move, which could be seen as a threat to its independence. And then there's the fact that Corbyn's party is not in power, and that the BBC's funding arrangements and operating agreement, or charter, is set in stone until 2027.

Based on analysts, leaks, and reports, we have an idea of what Apple could be launching this fall.   Here's everything you need to know about the 2018 iPhone lineup:   Since 2012, Apple has unveiled its latest iPhone in September. Typically, the new phone is available to preorder a few days after Apple's announcement.   Here's the recent history:   The short answer to what to expect from the new iPhones is more Face ID, Apple's facial-recognition software that replaced the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone X. Signs are pointing to it becoming a default feature on this year's models.   Apple watchers are expecting three new iPhones this year: one that looks like the iPhone X but with updated components, one that's a supersized version of the iPhone X, and one that's a less expensive iPhone with an edge-to-edge LCD screen and facial recognition that could cost $649 to $749.  Source:  9to5Mac. More details about the leak are available over there.  There would be tradeoffs though. The lower-end phone is said to have an LCD screen instead of the OLED one found on the iPhone X, worsening the display quality. Rumors have also suggested that it could be equipped with a single-lens camera, compared with the double- or even triple-lens cameras on the higher-end iPhones.    For more, check out  our list of all the best new features in iOS 12.  Source: 9to5Mac  9to5Mac reported that the two pricier models would most likely be called  iPhone XS.

What Apple will call the new laptop is still a mystery though, and Bloomberg reports it could be called the MacBook Air or simply the new MacBook, but for now we'll just refer to it as the new MacBook Air.   The MacBook Air has gotten plenty of internal upgrades over the years, but consumers have been looking at the same form factor since 2011. Still, at $999, it's currently the most affordable Mac laptop you can buy.   But all of that could change very soon.   Here's what we're expecting from the new MacBook Air reportedly coming later this year:   Apple retired the 11-inch MacBook Air in 2016.   The MacBook Air is currently the only Apple-made laptop without a Retina display.   You could probably expect something similar to the Huawei MateBook X Pro, another laptop with razor-thin bezels.   It could be called a MacBook Air, as a true sequel to the 13-inch model that retails for $999, or it could be a successor to the 12-inch MacBook that released in 2015, which starts at $1,299.   Bloomberg said the starting price of the 12-inch MacBook ""put it out of reach for some consumers,"" so it would be reasonable to expect the familiar MacBook Air branding, especially if it has a similar price point.   Apple will also reportedly introduce a new Mac Mini around the same time as this new laptop, according to Bloomberg.   ",0.0,0.972,0.028,0.7351

To be the first to know, please  click here.  Apple reportedly  removed 25,000 gambling-related apps from its App Store in China, according to Bloomberg. The move comes shortly after Apple was  under fire from state-run news outlets for hosting illegal gambling and fake lottery ticket apps on its China App Store. The recent app purge represents 1.4% of Apple's China App Store volume,  according to The Wall Street Journal.  createPerformanceMark('first image displayed');                                            Business Insider Intelligence                                      This is just the latest concession Apple's made to accommodate China's strict regulatory body. In November, Apple announced the  removal of several virtual private network (VPN) services from its App Store in China after the Chinese government had been pressuring the tech giant to ban all unapproved VPNs — which allow users to bypass China's heavily regulated internet. And in February, Apple  moved all of its Chinese-based iCloud accounts from its own servers to state-run servers to comply with Chinese data sharing policies.   Staying on China's good side is crucial for Apple as it relies heavily on the region as a source of revenue and growth.   Maintaining strong ties with China's government is even more important now as Google's been making moves to reintroduce its services in the region for the first time since 2010. Recent reports show that Google is  planning to launch a number of new products in China across its search, news, and cloud services, which would open the door for Google to bring its Google Play app store back to the region.   The reintroduction of Google Play would be particularly useful for the Android OS in China because the region's Android app market is highly fragmented with numerous app stores available, meaning developers need to create multiple versions of each app to suit each vendor's hardware.   If app developers in China can publish a single app for the Android ecosystem on Google Play, they could grow their reach in comparison to the iOS App Store, which is China's  leading mobile app store by downloads.

By Stephen Nellis  (Reuters) - Apple Inc has acquired a startup focused on making lenses for augmented reality glasses, the company confirmed on Wednesday, a signal Apple has ambitions to make a wearable device that would superimpose digital information on the real world.  Apple confirmed it acquired Longmont, Colorado-based Akonia Holographics. “Apple buys smaller companies from time to time, and we generally don’t discuss our purpose or plans,” the iPhone maker said in a statement.  Akonia could not immediately be reached for comment. The company was founded in 2012 by a group of holography scientists and had originally focused on holographic data storage before shifting its efforts to creating displays for augmented reality glasses, according to its website.  In augmented reality, digital information is overlaid on the real world as in the popular game Pokemon Go. Mobile phones use their camera system to do this on the phone’s screen, but major technology firms are racing to create glasses that will show digital information on transparent lenses.   Akonia said its display technology allows for “thin, transparent smart glass lenses that display vibrant, full-color, wide field-of-view images.” The firm has a portfolio of more than 200 patents related to holographic systems and materials, according to its website.  Akonia also said it raised $11.6 million in seed funding in 2012 and was seeking additional funding. It was unclear whether that funding ever materialized or who the firm’s investors were.  The purchase price and date of the acquisition could not be learned, though one executive in the augmented reality industry said the Akonia team had become “very quiet” over the past six months, implying that the deal may have happened in the first half of 2018.   Apple has a history of buying smaller companies whose technologies show up years later in its products. In 2013, Apple acquired a small Israeli firm called PrimeSense that made three-dimensional sensors. The iPhone X, launched last year, used a similar sensor to power facial recognition features.  Bloomberg last year reported that Apple was developing augmented reality glasses that could ship as early as 2020. Apple declined to comment on its plans or products.   But the company last year launched augmented reality applications for its iPhones and iPads, and CEO Tim Cook has called augmented reality a “big and profound” technology development.  “This is one of those huge things that we’ll look back at and marvel on the start of it,” Cook said of augmented reality on a conference call with investors last year.  The Akonia acquisition is the first clear indication of how Apple might handle one of the most daunting challenges in augmented reality hardware: Producing crystal clear optical displays thin and light enough to fit into glasses similar to everyday frames with images bright enough for outdoor use and suited to mass manufacturing at a relatively low price.  Augmented reality headsets currently on the market such as Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) HoloLens and startup Magic Leap’s Magic Leap One both use darkened lenses and are intended for indoor use. Both are also intended for software developers testing the technology and cost several thousand dollars.

In a reorganization spanning three sectors, none of the so-called FANG high-growth stocks - Facebook (FB.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - will be classified as technology companies, even though investors widely view them as the leaders of a tech rally that has powered the stock market higher in recent years.  On Sept. 24, S&P; will shift Alphabet, Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N), Paypal (PYPL.O) and videogame makers Electronic Arts (EA.O) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) from the S&P; 500 technology index to an expanded telecom group, renamed “Communications Services.”   Netflix, which like Amazon, is currently part of the consumer discretionary group, will also move to the expanded telecom group. Amazon will stay put in consumer discretionary.  The changes are part the largest-ever reorganization of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, an industry taxonomy widely used by investors. MSCI will adjust its indexes in November.   Meant to reflect the economy’s evolution, the overhaul of GICS will affect how mutual fund managers choose between stocks, and force passively managed sector funds to reallocate billions of dollars. Removing Alphabet and Facebook from technology indexes may lead investors to pay more attention to smaller, remaining technology companies.  “People will be able to get a clear look at the tech sector without being overwhelmed by these behemoths that really are media companies,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.   Exchange-traded funds that passively track indexes have about $89 billion invested in the technology sector, much of which will have to be reinvested to stay in line with the sector changes, potentially creating volatility, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper.  While many individual investors will still view Alphabet and Facebook as tech stocks, mutual funds have internal rules limiting how much they can invest across different sectors.  With Facebook and Alphabet shifted into the communications sector, fund managers will no longer have to choose between them and Apple or Microsoft (MSFT.O), or bets on chipmakers and cloud-computing, said Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Palfrey.   “And at the same time, an investor can go to the communications sector and overweight an internet services company against a traditional telecom company,” Palfrey said. “This is important for investors who have mandates to stay within certain parameters of a sector.”    Technology stocks have been top performers driving Wall Street’s gains in recent years, including Apple (AAPL.O), which currently makes up 16 percent of the S&P; 500 IT index .SPLRCT.   Apple will increase its weight in that index to 20 percent following the removal of No. 2 component Alphabet and Facebook, its fourth largest member.  The changes will also increase the weight of smaller tech companies. Microsoft, Visa (V.N), Intel (INTC.O) and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) will round out the S&P; 500 IT index’s largest five components, followed by Mastercard (MA.N), Oracle (ORCL.N)  and Nvidia (NVDA.O).    (Graphic: Future S&P; 500 IT Index: reut.rs/2MrVmfi)  (Graphic: Current S&P; 500 IT Index: reut.rs/2MtpV47)  Even without some of its highest-profile members, the technology sector will boast companies with track records for earnings growth and stock performance.   Share prices of Visa and Mastercard, not typically viewed as tech companies, in 2018 have surged 23 percent and 34 percent, respectively.  The S&P; 500 tech sector under its future configuration would have gained 18 percent so far in 2018, outperforming the 16 percent rise under its current configuration, according to Palfrey.   In its future configuration, the S&P; 500 tech sector is currently trading at about 18 times expected earnings, compared to 19 times earnings with its current constituents.  (Graphic: S&P; 500 tech: New vs. Old: reut.rs/2MqQMOy)  Following the GICS restructure, tech will account for 21 percent of the S&P; 500, compared to 26 percent currently, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Shares of AAC plunged almost 11 percent after the company said net profit dropped 39 percent from a year earlier to 653 million yuan ($95 million), the first quarterly fall since July-September 2014. The stock later recovered, closing 1.3 percent higher.   “Apple in terms of volumes is hitting a plateau this year, and while it has been successful in driving product prices and profits, volume stagnation affects its suppliers,” said Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research.   AAC, which supplies acoustic and haptic components for Apple products such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, was estimated by research and brokerage firm Sanford Bernstein to derive half of its revenues from the U.S. tech giant.   While Apple reported better-than-expected results for the June quarter, shipment volumes for iPhone and iPad were almost flat from a year earlier.  AAC’s quarterly revenue fell 14.5 percent to 3.79 billion yuan, the biggest such drop since 2009, with margins also hit by a stronger yuan.  The company, which also supplies leading Chinese smartphone makers including Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], said smartphone unit sales were weaker than expected in the quarter amid a shrinking global smartphone market.       AAC competes against China’s Goertek and US-based Knowles as one of the world’s largest acoustic component makers. Shah at Counterpoint said the increasing number of products with microphones, such as smart speakers and TVs represent a bigger business opportunity, but competition is also tough.  AAC managing director Richard Mok told a media briefing that the company expects better profit margins in the traditionally stronger second half of the year, citing growth potential for its new optic lens business.   The escalating China-U.S. trade war is not hitting the company directly at the moment, Mok said, with none of its products or components on the list of those imposed with higher tariffs.   AAC, whose shares have fallen 37 percent this year, said its  permanent staff fell 27 percent in the first half to 38,176 as it adopted more automation, which analysts said implies cost savings for the second half.

Shares of AAC plunged almost 11 percent after the company said net profit dropped 39 percent from a year earlier to 653 million yuan ($95 million), the first quarterly fall since July-September 2014. The stock later recovered, closing 1.3 percent higher.   “Apple in terms of volumes is hitting a plateau this year, and while it has been successful in driving product prices and profits, volume stagnation affects its suppliers,” said Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research.   AAC, which supplies acoustic and haptic components for Apple products such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, was estimated by research and brokerage firm Sanford Bernstein to derive half of its revenues from the U.S. tech giant.   While Apple reported better-than-expected results for the June quarter, shipment volumes for iPhone and iPad were almost flat from a year earlier.  AAC’s quarterly revenue fell 14.5 percent to 3.79 billion yuan, the biggest such drop since 2009, with margins also hit by a stronger yuan.  The company, which also supplies leading Chinese smartphone makers including Huawei Technologies, said smartphone unit sales were weaker than expected in the quarter amid a shrinking global smartphone market.       AAC competes against China’s Goertek and US-based Knowles as one of the world’s largest acoustic component makers. Shah at Counterpoint said the increasing number of products with microphones, such as smart speakers and TVs represent a bigger business opportunity, but competition is also tough.  AAC managing director Richard Mok told a media briefing that the company expects better profit margins in the traditionally stronger second half of the year, citing growth potential for its new optic lens business.   The escalating China-U.S. trade war is not hitting the company directly at the moment, Mok said, with none of its products or components on the list of those imposed with higher tariffs.   AAC, whose shares have fallen 37 percent this year, said its  permanent staff fell 27 percent in the first half to 38,176 as it adopted more automation, which analysts said implies cost savings for the second half.

The new deal is an expansion of the existing Hulu  and Spotify bundle for students, which launched around a year ago at the same price. Now those existing subscribers as well as new ones will be able to stream from all three services when they sign up. The new bundle consists of Spotify Premium for Students, Hulu with Limited Commercials, and Showtime . Students will need to be attending a Title IV accredited institution in the U.S. to qualify for the discounted pricing. When Spotify teamed up with Hulu back in September 2017, it was the first time it had ever partnered with a streaming video service on a bundle deal. The deal had arrived just as Spotify’s own efforts into original video were failing, and its head of video Tom Calderone was departing amid a shift in content strategy. For both Spotify and Hulu, a bundle of music and video allows them to steel themselves against the looming threat from Apple, and its expected launch of its own streaming video service, which itselfÂ could be bundled with an Apple Music subscription. Because of Apple’s built-in advantage that comes with the iPhone, Apple Music has already outpaced Spotify in the U.S. – and clearly, the streaming services are concerned about its video plans.  According to Spotify, the reasoning behind a bundle has to do with the fact that college students are streaming entertainment more than any other age group. It wanted to reach them with better pricing, it says. “We’ve been really pleased about the uptake of the original Hulu bundle, so are happy to be expanding the offering,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. The company, however, declined to share the number of students who had taken advantage of the bundle discount so far. Spotify had also expanded this same bundle to all customers in April, at $12.99 per month for both, instead of $7.99 per month for Hulu and $9.99 per month for Spotify, when sold separately. Spotify has added subscribers since those launches, but it’s unclear how many were from bundles. Today, it has 83 million paying subscribers out of 180 million monthly users. That’s up from the 60 million paying subscribers it had when the student bundle was first announced, when it was then twice as big as Apple Music. With the addition of Showtime, students will be able to watch series like “Shameless,” “Who Is America?,” “The Chi,” “Billions,” “Ray Donovan,” “Smilf,” “The Affair,” Homeland,” “Twin Peaks,” the upcoming Jim Carrey comedy “Kidding,” and upcoming “Escape at Dannemora,” among others, plus movies, documentaries, sports and comedy specials. Showtime currently costs $10.99 per month over-the-top, when purchased directly from the network itself, though it’s possible to find it for less elsewhere. For example, Amazon Channels sells the subscription a la carte for $8.99 per month, at present. To get all three services for $4.99 per month is an almost ridiculous price at this point, and one that’s intended to serve as a way to addict students at a time when their media consumption is heavy, so they’ll become avid users. Once students have created their playlists, downloaded their songs, followed their favorite bands, networks, and shows, they will benefit from the personalization these services offer. After a few years’ time, it will be difficult for the students to abandon the services when the price increases after graduation – or, at least, that’s the thinking on the streamers’ part. Spotify won’t discuss the partnership particulars, but it’s obviously subsidizing the services here. To sign up for the triple-play bundle, students can go to spotify.com/us/student. During the first three months, Spotify will only be $0.99, bringing the cost down even further.",0.029,0.894,0.077,0.9699

While Apple  stopped selling AirPort products back in April, the company is still updating the firmware of the once beloved AirPort Express. This firmware update is quite significant as it adds support for AirPlay 2 and the Home app. In other words, you can now plug speakers to a dusty AirPort Express and turn them into wireless speakers for your home sound system. The AirPort Express was a pretty basic home router. It hasnât been updated since 2012, which means that itâs nowhere near as performant as todayâs cheap routers. It only supports 802.11n while everybody has moved on to 802.11ac. Its Ethernet ports are limited to 100 Mbps. So if you have fiber internet, the AirPort Express is not a good solution as it caps your internet connection to 100 Mbps. But the AirPort Express also has an audio jack â something that you canât find in many Apple products these days. Todayâs update makes this audio jack relevant again, as itâs a cheap way to get started with AirPlay 2. After updating the device with the AirPort Utility app on your Mac or iOS device, you can launch the Home app and add the router as a new Home accessory. After that, youâll find the AirPort Express in your AirPlay speaker list. Apple recently released AirPlay 2, an update to its audio and video protocol. With AirPlay 2, you can stream music from your Apple devices to multiple speakers at once. On your phone, you can control the volume of each speaker individually and play the same song across your home. While Sonos, Bose and other speaker manufacturers are updating their devices to support AirPlay 2, chances are many devices wonât get an update. The AirPort Express update can help you go through this transition.",0.039,0.881,0.081,0.9065

The latest figures from Gartner put Huawei ahead on sales to end users in Q2. Overall, Gartner  says sales of smartphones to end users grew 2% in the quarter, to reach 374 million units. The analyst pegs the Chinese smartphone maker with a 13.3% marketshare, saying it sold ~49.8M devices in the quarter, up from 9.8% in the year before quarter — ahead of Apple,  which it calculates took an 11.9% marketshare (down from 12.1% in Q2 2017), selling ~44.7M iPhones.  According to Gartner’s figures, Samsung also lost share year-over-year — declining 12.7% in the quarter. The Galaxy smartphone maker retained its no.1 spot in the rankings, with 19.3% in Q2 (vs 22.6% in the equivalent quarter last year) and ~72.3M devices sold. Though Gartner notes it’s being squeezed by “ever-growing competition from Chinese manufacturers”, while slowing demand for its flagships are squeezing its profitability. Not a happy combination. In recent years Huawei has been one of a handful of Chinese OEMsÂ bucking the trend of a slowing global smartphone market. And Gartner’s data suggests Huaweiâs smartphone sales grew 38.6 per cent in the second quarter.  As we noted earlier this month, when other analysts reported Huawei outstripping Apple on smartphone shipments in Q2, the handset maker has built momentum for its mid-range Honor handset brand while performing solidly at the premium end too, with devices such as theÂ P20 ProÂ (albeit while copypasting Apple’s iPhone X ‘notch’ screen design in that instance.) “Huawei continues to bring innovative features into its smartphones and expand its smartphone portfolio to cover larger consumer segments,”Â said research director Anshul Gupta in a statement.Â “Its investment into channels, brand building and positioning of the Honor devices helped drive sales. Huawei is shipping its Honor smartphones into 70 markets worldwide and is emerging as Huaweiâs key growth driver.” For Apple the quarter was a flat one (0.9% growth), though that’s to be expected given Cupertino structures its mobile release cycle around a big-bang annual smartphone refresh in the fall, ahead of the holiday quarter, rather than releasing devices throughout the year. Even so, Gupta noted that Apple is also facing growing competition from Chinese brands, which in turn is amping up pressure on the company to innovate its handsets to keep increasingly demanding consumers happy by delivering “enhanced value” in exchange for the iPhone’s premium price. And recentÂ reports have suggested Apple is prepping a number of iPhone design changes for fall, including a splash of color. âDemand for the iPhone X has started to slow down much earlier than when other new models were introduced,” he added, sounding another note of concern for Apple. Fourth placed Chinese OEM Xiaomi  is one device maker putting pressure on longer term players in the smartphone market. In Q2 Gartner reckons the company sold ~32.8M devices, carving itself an 8.8% marketshare — up from 5.8% in the year ago quarter. The analyst’s data also shows Google’s Android  operating system further extending its lead over Apple’s iOS in Q2, securing 88% market share vs 11.9% for iOS. While the smartphone market is no longer a simple duopoly on the device maker front, with Huawei elbowing past Apple to bag the second spot in the global rankings, it remains very much the opposite story where smartphone operating systems are concerned. And Gartner’s data now records the ‘other’ category of smartphone OSes at a 0.0% marketshare, down from 0.1% in the year ago quarter… ",0.03,0.908,0.062,0.9433

It sounds likely that Apple is going to introduce three new phones in September â an updated iPhone X, a bigger phone and a successor to the iPhone 8 with the iPhone X design. The updated iPhone X could be considered as an âS upgradeâ with a better system-on-a-chip and better cameras. The phone itself could look exactly the same as the iPhone X you can buy today. But you can expect faster performance thanks to an updated A12 chip designed by Apple  and manufactured by TSMC. The bigger device could feature a gigantic 6.5-inch display. It should have exactly the same features as the updated iPhone X â stainless steel edges, two cameras on the back, an OLED display, etc. This model could have two SIM slots in some countries to make it easier to roam in other regions and countries. More interestingly, Apple wants to replace the iPhone 8 with a device inspired by the iPhone X. It could cost around as much as the iPhone 8 today, but it should be a big upgrade for those who are focused on the entry-level model. Of course, there will be some compromises. For instance, Apple will replace the stainless steel edges with aluminum edges. There should be a single camera on the back. And the display wonât be as sharp as it should be a 6.1-inch LCD display. A previous rumor indicated that this new model could come in a wide range of colors including grey, white, blue, red and orange. Bloomberg confirms that the disappearance of the home button means that this phone will get Face ID. On the software side, it sounds like the bigger 6.5-inch iPhone could let you run two apps side-by-side, pretty much like opening two apps on the iPad. If Apple follows its usual pattern, the company should unveil these new devices in just a couple of weeks.",0.0,0.908,0.092,0.9762

A study from the U.S-based Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rel…",2018-08-26 14:06:53,techcrunch,Kencko wants to help you eat more fruit and vegetables,http://techcrunch.com/2018/08/26/kencko/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/kencko-2.jpg?w=749,"People don’t eat enough fruit and vegetables, that’s despite an embarrassment of options today that include fast grocery delivery and takeout services with a focus on health. A study from the U.S-based Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released last November found that just one in ten adults in America “meet the federal fruit or vegetable recommendations” each day. The bar isn’t that high. The recommendation is just 1.5-2 cups of fruit and two to three cups of vegetables per day, but failing to meet it can put people at risk of chronic diseases, the CDC said. The problem is universal the world over, but perhaps most acute in the U.S,Â where finding healthy food is easier than ever.Â Amazon’s same-day grocery deliveries, make-it-at-home services like Blue Apron  and various healthy takeout services have helped some people, but no doubt there’s much more to be done for standards to be raised across the nation and beyond. That’s where one early-stage startup, Kencko, is aiming to make a difference by making fruit and vegetable more accessible. Its thesis is that wholly organic diets are daunting to most, but packaging the good parts in new ways can make it easier for anyone to be more healthy. The company’s first offering is a fruit drink that can be made in minutes using just a sachet, water andÂ its mixer bottle. Kencko currently offers five different organic fruit and vegetable mixes Unlike other ‘instant’ mixer options, Kencko uses freeze-drying to turn fruit and vegetable mixes into powder without compromising on health. That process — which is similar to how NASA develops food for astronauts — retains minerals, protein, vitamins and all the other good stuff typically lost in healthy drinks, the startup said. The fruit and vegetables used are organic and sourced from across the world — that’s broken down into more details on the Kencko website — while the mixes don’t contain sugar or other additives. Kencko customers make their drink by mixing the sachet with water and shaking for one minute. Each sachet is 20g and, when combined with water, that gets you a 160g serving. That’s around two daily portions, and itÂ  has a 180-day shelf live so it can keep.Â There are six different combinations, each one is a mixture of six fruit and vegetables. Unlike others that pair with water, KenckoÂ actually includes fruit pieces and seeds — I tested a batch.Â That’s pretty unique, although it is worth noting that some of theÂ more berry fruit heavy combinations mix less efficiently than the plant-based ones, at least from my experience. As someone who lives in a city where fresh fruit and vegetables are easily found — thank you, Bangkok — I’m not the target customer. But I can readily recallÂ living the busy 9-6 office life in London a decade ago, and back then I’d have been curious enough to at least take Kencko for a spin in my quest to be a little healthier. Kencko is also affordable when compared to most health food options, which tend to be positioned as premium. Packs are priced at $29.90 for ten sachets, $74.50 for 30 and $123.50 for 60. TheÂ startup offers a ‘Lifetime Founding Member’ package that gives 30 percent off those prices for an initial charge. That’s $32 for those wanting 10 servinggs, $79.90 for 30 and $129 for 60. Two of my Kencko mixes KenckoÂ — which means health in Japanese —Â is the brainchild ofÂ TomÃ¡s Froes, a former tech worker who got into veganism after being diagnosed withÂ acute gastritis. Froes, who is from Portugal and once ran an artisanalÂ hot dog brand in China, was told that his ailment was treatable but that it would require a cocktail of pills for the rest of his life. Seeking an alternative, he threw himself into the world of alternative health and, after settling onÂ a 90 percent fruit and vegetable diet, found that his condition had cleared without medicine. Keen to help others enjoy the benefits of his journey, he began talking to nutritionistsÂ and experts whilst trying to figure out possible business options. In an interview with TechCrunch,Â Froes said he settled on a new take on the existing ‘health drink’ space that he maintains is inadequate in a number of ways. “The end goal is to help consumers reach the recommendation of fiveÂ servings/portions of fruit a day,” he explained. “That would be impossible to do if we excluded the seeds and bits of fruits like cold-pressed juice companies do. They press the juice out of the fruits, leaving the most nutritional part from pulp and the seeds out.” “WeÂ blast freeze fruit and vegetables at -40 degrees which allows us toÂ maintain the same nutritional properties as fresh fruit for longer periods. We then use aÂ slow heat process of 60 degrees to evaporate only take the water-based parts without damaging nutrition,” Froes added. Added that, Froes said, Kencko helps cut down on the use of plastic by using the same mixer, return customers only require new sachets. As proof of Kencko’s versatility, he brought his mixer and sachets along to the vegan cafe we met at earlier this year when I visited London, putting me to shame for buying the cold pressed option — which was no doubt more expensive, to boot. Kencko is based in New York but with a processing facility in Lisbon, Portugal. It is heavily focused on the U.S. market where it offers delivery in 24-48 hours, but it also covers the UK and Canada. There are plans to increase support, particularly in Asia. Kencko’s Apple Watch app is in beta with selected users Kencko was formed in 2017 and, after landing undisclosed seed funding, it launched its product in March of this year. Already it has seen progress; the startup recently entered the TechStars accelerator program in London as one of a batch of ten companies. “I’m excited to work with Tomas and the Kencko team,” Eamonn Carey, who leads TechStars in London, told TechCrunch. “I first read about them on ProductHunt and bought into their mission straight away. Once I tasted the product for the first time, I was sold — both as a subscriber and an investor.” Froes told TechCrunch that drinks are just the first phase of what Kencko hopes to offer consumers. He explained that he wants to move into other types of food and consumables in theÂ future to help give people more options to get their daily portion of fruit and vegetables. Up next could be Apple-based snacks. Foes shared — quite literally — a new batch of snack that’s currently in development and is made from the fruit. He believes it could be marketed a healthier option than crisps and other nibbles people turn to between meals. Further down the pipeline, he said, will be other kinds of food that maintain the 100 percent organic approach. Beyond food, Kencko wants to build a close bond with its customers. It is developing iOS and Apple Watch apps that help its users to track their fruit and vegetable consumption, and more generally make their diet and routine healthier. With the membership package and apps, it becomes clearÂ that Kencko aspires to build a brand and not just sell aÂ product online. That’s double the challenge (at least), and that makes the company one to watch. Already it has found some success within tech circles such as TechStar’s Carey — people who aspire to eat and drink better but are pushed for time — but if Froes is to even begin to deliver on his mission then Kencko will need to go beyond the tech industry niche and attract mainstream consumers. For now though, the product is worth close inspection if you think your lifestyle is in need of a fruit boost.",0.037,0.86,0.103,0.998

There is nothing wrong with digging into these breaks to see if they reach the goals governments set in terms of net new jobs. But Amazon isn’t alone here by any means. Many states have a big tech subsidy story to tell, and it isn’t always a tale that ends well for the subsidizing government. In fact, a recent studyÂ by the watchdog group, Good Jobs First, found states are willing to throw millions at high tech companies to lure them into building in their communities. They cited three examples in the report including Teslaâs $1.25 billion 20-year deal to build a battery factory in Nevada, Foxconn’s $3 billion break to build a display factoryÂ in Wisconsin and the Apple data center deal in Iowa, which resulted in a $214 million tax break. Good Jobs First executive director Greg LeRoy doesn’t think these subsidies are justifiable and they take away business development dollars from smaller businesses that tend to build more sustainable jobs in a community. “The âlots of eggs in one basketâ strategy is especially ill-suited. But many public leaders havenât switched gears yet, often putting taxpayers at great risk, especially because some tech companies have become very aggressive about demanding big tax breaks. Companies with famous names are even more irresistible to politicians who want to look active on jobs,” LeRoy and his colleague Maryann Feldman wrote in a Guardian commentary last month. While these deals are designed to attract the company to an area and generate jobs, that doesn’t always happen. The Apple-Iowa deal, for example, involved 550 construction jobs to build the $1.3 billion state-of-the-art facility, but will ultimately generate only 50 full-time jobs. It’s worth noting that in this case, Apple further sweetened the pot by contributing “up to $100 million” to a local public improvement fund, according to information supplied by the company. One thing many lay people don’t realize, however, is that in spite of the size, cost and amount of real estate of these mega data centers, they are highly automated and don’t require a whole lot of people to run. While Apple is giving back to the community around the data center, in the end, if the goal of the subsidy is permanent high-paying jobs, there aren’t very many involved in running a data center. It’s not hard to find projects that didn’t work out. A $2 million tax subsidy deal between Massachusetts and Nortel Networks in 2008 to keep 2200 jobs in place and add 800 more failed miserably. By 2010 there were just 145 jobs left at the facility and the tax incentive lasted another 4 years, according to a Boston.com report. More recent deals come at a much higher price. The $3 billion Foxconn deal in Wisconsin was expected to generate 3000 direct jobs (and another 22,000 related ones). That comes out to an estimated cost of between $15,000 and $19,000 per job annually, much higher than the typical cost of $2457 per job,Â according to data in the New York Times. Meanwhile states are falling all over themselves with billions in subsidies to give Amazon  whatever its little heart desires to build HQ2, which could generate up to 50,000 jobs over a decade if all goes according to plan. The question, as with the Foxconn deal, is whether the states can truly justify the cost per job and the impact on infrastructure and housing to make it worth it? What’s more, how do you ensure that you get a least a modest return on that investment? In the case of the Nortel example in Massachusetts, shouldn’t the Commonwealth have protected itself against a catastrophic failure instead of continuing to give the tax break for years after it was clear Nortel wasn’t able to live up to its side of the agreement? Not every deal needs to be a home run, but you want to at least ensure you get a decent number of net new jobs out of it, and that there is some fairness in the end, regardless of the outcome. States also need to figure out the impact of any subsidy on other economic development plans, and not simply fall for name recognition over common sense. These are questions every state needs to be considering as they pour money into these companies. It’s understandable in post-industrial America, where many factory jobs have been automated away that states want to lure high-paying high tech jobs to their communities, but it’s still incumbent upon officials to make sure they are doing due diligence on the total impact of the deal to be certain the cost is justified in the end.",0.037,0.875,0.088,0.9863

According to a message in the app’s update text in its latest App Store release this week, only those users running iOS 10 or higher will continue to have a supported mobile client. The company’s message notes this decision will allow it to streamline its app development for all clients. Typically, moving off older platforms means a company can more quickly roll out new features and take advantage of the benefits provided by newer frameworks, without worrying how to support legacy users along the way. It’s not unprecedented for social apps to make this choice, either – LinkedIn and Snapchat also only support iOS 10 or higher.Â Facebook, meanwhile, caters to anyone on iOS 9 or above. iOS 10 was released nearly 2 years ago, and next month, Apple device owners will gain access to the public release of iOS 12.  Ditching older versions of iOS is not as risky for Twitter as ditching users on older versions of Android, because a majority of iOS users upgrade when Apple rolls out a new mobile operating system. In fact, Apple’s data indicates only 5% percent of users are still on iOS 9 or below. At Apple’s scale, that’s still millions, but translated to Twitter’s install base it’s a much lower number. During its Q2 2018 earnings, Twitter said it had 335 million monthly active users. And of course, many of those are running Twitter on Android. Presumably a very, very small percentage of users are on iOS 9 or below. Twitter must believe it’s small enough to be an acceptance loss, if it comes to that. This would hardly be news except for the fact that the decision comes at a time when Twitter is losing users – it lost 1 millionÂ users in Q2 – and when Twitter has been killing off a number of other client applications, as well. The company had already shut down many versions of the TweetDeck client app it acquired, and this year it shuttered Twitter for Mac along with most of its TV apps. It also ended support for legacy APIs, knowing that doing so would impact third-party clients’ ability to operate. And now it’s shedding a small number of iOS users, too. Twitter says that anyone still running iOS 9 or older will no longer receive updates, so those who want to receive performance improvements, bug fixes and new features will need to upgrade. With all these changes, it’s clear that Twitter is focused on limiting the number of platforms it has to support, so it can better address the needs of its users. Time will tell if it’s successful with that, however.",0.043,0.828,0.13,0.9862

Starting tomorrow, August 24, and continuing through the 31st, Apple says it will donate $1 to the National Park Foundation for every purchase made using Apple Pay online at apple.com, or through the Apple Store app in the U.S. It’s also introducing a National Park-themed Apple Watch Activity Challenge to accompany the donation program. Starting on September 1, Apple Watch users worldwide who either walk, run, or do a wheelchair workout of 50 minutes or more will earn an Activity app award and stickers that are inspired by national parks. The 50 minutes is a tribute to Redwood National Park’s 50th anniversary, which is this year. Related to these efforts, the App Store will also feature a round-up of some of the best apps to use to explore the U.S. National Parks.  Apple says the proceeds from the donation program will support theÂ National Park Foundationâs mission to protect national parks. This includes projects focused on habitat restoration, historic preservation, and the Open OutDoors for Kids program. âAmericaâs national parks are treasures everyone should experience, and weâre proud to support them again this month by donating a dollar for every purchase made with Apple Pay at one of our stores,â said Appleâs CEO Tim Cook, in a statement about the program. âThese awe-inspiring places are our national inheritance, and Apple is doing our part to pass them on to future generations â just as extraordinary, beautiful and wild as we found them.â The company also took the time today to highlight the success of a related initiative, saying it has protected and created enough sustainably managed forests to cover its current and future paper use. In partnership with The Conversation Fund, Apple has protected 36,000 acres of U.S. forests that are sustainably managed, it noted. This is not the first time Apple has hosted such a challenge for the U.S. National Parks. Last year, it ran the same event, making mention of the fact that Apple Pay was accepted at some national parks, likeÂ Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and Muir Woods National Monument, for example. The event itself now has political undertones, given the current administration’s rethinking of national parks, and its interest in deregulating the oil and gas extraction on public lands.",0.01,0.847,0.143,0.9947

The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple has deemed Facebook-owned app Onavo in violation of its App Store policies and will be giving it the boot shortly. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Apple  spokesperson explained the reasoning behind its decision to pull the app: We work hard to protect user privacy and data security throughout the Apple ecosystem. With the latest update to our guidelines, we made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a userâs device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing and must make it clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used. In some ways, it’s a wonder that Onavo  has lasted this long. Onavo, which Facebook bought back in 2013, does two things. As far as regular consumers are concerned, Onavo comports itself like a VPN, offering to “keep you and your data safe” and “blocking potentially harmful websites and securing your personal information.”  But Onavo’s real utility is pumping a ton of app usage data to its parent company, giving Facebook an invaluable bird’s-eye view into mobile trends by observing which apps are gaining traction and which are fizzling out. That perspective is useful both from a product standpoint, allowing Facebook to get ahead of the competition (Snapchat is a fine example), and giving it an edge for considering which competitors to acquire. That dual personality is likely part of the problem for Apple. In its descriptions, Onavo leans heavily on its promise to “protect your personal information” and the cover story of a fairly legitimate looking VPN. With no meaningful opt-in for users who want to use Onavo’s VPN services but might be hesitant about sharing data with Facebook, the app’s true intentions were buried deep in its description: “Onavo collects your mobile data traffic… Because we’re part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.” By February of this year, the Onavo app had been downloaded more than 33 million times across both iOS and Android. While the app is no longer showing up in searches within Apple’s App Store, it’s still alive and well in Google’s considerably more free-wheeling app store, so Facebook will have to lean more heavily on its Android eyes and ears for now.",0.027,0.853,0.121,0.9886

Thatâs according to the U.S. Apple Association, a trade group, which released its production forecast for 2018 last week. âItâs the beginning of the end,â said Tom Burford, an apple historian, orchard consultant and admitted Red Delicious detractor. âHow are you going to market a tasteless apple when the consumer has tasted so many good apples?â Despite his bias, Mr. Burford has a point: The decline of the Red Delicious, with its mild flavor and often mealy texture, can be credited to a shift in consumer preferences toward apples that are crunchier, crisper and sweeter. âItâs the industry adapting to the consumerâs demands,â said Mark Seetin, the director of industry affairs for the Apple Association, who, unlike Mr. Burford, is more sanguine about the apple varietyâs future. The Red Delicious is still projected to be the second most-popular apple by production in America, according to the group, which claims 7,500 growers as members. The Granny Smith will be third, followed by Fuji and the ascendant Honeycrisp, which could rise to third place as soon as 2020, just three decades after its introduction, the trade group said. While the country had native apples, the most common domestic varieties today are descendants of centuries-old imports from Europe, according to âApples of North America,â a book by Mr. Burford, whose family has been growing apples since the early 1700s. Apples were an important part of colonial America, used not only as food but often to make hard cider, a popular alternative to water that was unfit to drink, according to Erika Janik, the author of âApple: A Global Historyâ and executive producer of podcasts at New Hampshire Public Radio. âApples were some of the earliest things planted by colonists in the United States,â she said. âBasically everyone had an apple tree or two or three in their yard.â But the Red Delicious was a relative latecomer. It was discovered in the late 1800s by Jesse Hiatt, an Iowa farmer who reluctantly let a Red Delicious tree grow on his property after several unsuccessful attempts at killing it, according to various accounts. In the early 1890s, Mr. Hiatt entered the fruit, which he had named âHawkeye,â into an apple competition and won, ultimately agreeing to sell the rights to the contestâs hosts, the Stark Broâs Nursery, in Missouri, according to Mr. Burfordâs book. The Stark brothers, whose nursery is still operating more than a century later, renamed the apple âDeliciousâ and, later, âRed Deliciousâ to differentiate it from a yellow apple from West Virginia that they began to sell under the name âGolden Delicious,â according to the book. It enjoyed relative popularity for decades, but took off in the mid-20th century, with its distinctive elongated shape and five-point base becoming an American symbol, according to the book âApples of Uncommon Character,â by Rowan Jacobsen. Then things started to change. âWe left the farm,â Mr. Jacobsen said in an interview. âAs more and more people became city people and national supermarkets arose, you were no longer getting your own apples and you were no longer getting local apples.â To meet the demands of consumers who began to associate the color red with ripeness, apple growers and supermarkets produced and sold ever-redder apples at the expense of flavor. âWe started eating with our eyes and not our mouths,â Mr. Burford said. In recent decades, the trend has started to reverse itself, as consumers have begun to pay more attention to the provenance, variety and quality of goods, such as coffee, tomatoes, beer and, of course, apples. The Honeycrisp, for example, has soared in popularity, largely on the strength of its crispness and sweetness, since it was developed at the University of Minnesota and released in 1991. The shift in tastes isnât lost on the industry. Demand for new Red Delicious trees is falling and the growers see that thereâs a glut of the fruit they bear, according to Mr. Seetin, of the Apple Association. But he isnât ready to count out Red Delicious apples entirely: They still account for about half of apple exports and remain popular in other countries, like India. âTheyâre going to reach an equilibrium,â Mr. Seetin said. âI very seriously doubt theyâre just going to vanish from the picture.â   Advertisement",0.04,0.848,0.112,0.9956

By J. D. Biersdorfer Q. I subscribed to the digital version of a magazine from England and downloaded it, but itâs not showing up in my iPadâs books library. How do I find it? A. Digital magazine downloads are handled in different ways, depending on where you get them. Earlier versions of the iOS software included a feature called Newsstand that collected issues from most digital subscriptions in one place, but Apple discontinued it in 2015 in favor of Apple News. Some sites may offers copies as PDF files you can open in a web browser and save to the iBooks app (or the specific app you use to handle PDF files, like Adobe Reader). Some publications have stand-alone apps that store electronic issues within their own internal libraries. Digital publishers may also direct you to online folders or servers.  If youâre not sure, go back to the site where you signed up for the digital magazine and check its support area or frequently-asked-questions page. If you subscribed to the magazine through the App Store app on your iPad, the downloaded issues are most likely contained within a separate app of the same name â and not in the iPadâs iBooks library. (The Google Play store for Android has similar magazine apps.) Electronic bookstores like Amazon and Barnes & Noble also sell digital magazines, so you may find subscription downloads in the purchased content of the Amazon Kindle app or Barnes & Noble Nook app. Likewise, digital newsstand apps like Texture and Zinio file your downloads within the app you used to buy the subscription. The internet has several magazine-collection sites that offer free downloads of PDF periodicals or request payment to the site itself and not the magazineâs publisher. These types of sites often let you download a large PDF file in the tabletâs browser and then save the file to a designated PDF-viewer app. (Some of these sites are in legally gray areas, so be careful about where you share your credit-card information. When in doubt, go to the publisherâs website.)  If you like to read digitized copies of printed magazines, your local library may have a collection to read in its electronic collection that you use with the RB Digital app for iPad and your library card, so check with your local branch. The Internet Archive also has a free digital magazine collection to browse. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.

By J. D. Biersdorfer Q. If Windows comes with tools to help someone take control and troubleshoot another PC over the internet, what does Apple provide for long-distance Mac-to-Mac support? A. Apple includes several ways to see and control the screen of another Mac over a network connection. Perhaps the easiest approach for those who donât want to knock around in system settings is to use the Messages chat app. Both Macs involved in the remote assistance operation need Apple ID accounts and must be logged into the Messages app. If you are the one providing the technical assistance, open Messages, select the name of the person you plan to help â or send a new message to start the conversation â and click the Details button in the upper-right corner of the window. Click the Screen Share icon, which looks like two overlapping rectangles, and select âAsk to share screen.â (If youâre the one needing the help, you can also reach out via a Messages buddy and use the âInvite to Share My Screenâ option.)  The person on the other end of the sharing request needs to accept your offer. A box pops up to ask that person to let you observe or take command of the screen. Once the person chooses âControl my screenâ and clicks Accept, you should be able to take over that Mac with your own cursor and keyboard to provide remote technical support; the app also opens up an audio call between you and the other person so you can talk while you help. When you are finished, the recipient can close the session. If the Messages app is not an option, Appleâs support site has detailed instructions for setting up the Mac for sharing in System Preferences and using alternative screen-sharing methods or iCloudâs Back to My Mac feature (until Back to My Mac is discontinued in the next version of the operating system). If you are remotely trying to configure settings on someone elseâs Mac and you both have iOS devices, Appleâs FaceTime video chat app can be helpful for visual cues walking someone through setup steps; Microsoft Skype users can also share screens for visual reference.  Like Windows users, if you donât care for the built-in tools, you can also use free third-party programs like TeamViewer to give and get remote assistance. Edoviaâs $30 Screens 4 is another remote-control app and has a free trial version available. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.

64,Louise Matsakis,We're increasingly wary of sharing too much on social media. So why are we still doing it on Venmo?,2018-08-26 11:00:00,wired,Stop Sending Money on Venmo. There Are Better Alternatives,https://www.wired.com/story/venmo-alternatives/,/images/video-fallback/w-fallback-full.png,"Venmo, the popular payment app owned by PayPal, has become the default way millions of Americans settle a check, pay a friend back for coffee, or buy a concert ticket off Craigslist. Writers have argued that Venmoing makes us petty, and that the app has nearly killed cash. Fewer have questioned whether itâs really the best service for exchanging money, or storing sensitive banking information. The app has reigned supreme for over half a decade, but in 2018, there are more secure and easier-to-use payment options worth considering as replacements. Venmoing may be standard, but hereâs why Iâve switched. Most Venmo competitors, like Squareâs Cash app, share the same core feature: You can send money with a few taps and swipes. Venmo is unique in that it has a social networking component. By default, all peer-to-peer Venmo transactionsâaside from the payment amountâare public, to everyone in the world. Venmoâs insistence on mimicking a social networking app isn't just weirdâit can have unnerving consequences. Creepy, right? Venmo does give users the ability to limit who can see transactions both before and after they're sent, but many people donât choose to adjust their privacy settings. When I opened Venmo recently, the first payment on my news feed was from a friend whose concerns about privacy have led him to delete both his Instagram and Facebook accounts. Despite taking drastic steps to limit his digital footprint, I know who he ate sushi with last night, thanks to Venmo. Venmoâs insistence on mimicking a social networking app isn't just weirdâit can have unnerving consequences. In July, privacy advocate and designer Hang Do Thi Duc released Public by Default, a site that taps into Venmoâs API to highlight how much information can be gathered about you from your public activity on the app. She was able to trace the exact spending habits of a couple in California, documenting what stores they shopped at, when they took their dog to the vet, and when they made loan payments. The same month, an engineer created a now-defunct Twitter bot that documented Venmo payments referencing drugs. Three years earlier, two unrelated technologists made a similar site to track supposedly scandalous payments, which is still running. In the past, PayPal has insisted that users can simply change their Venmo settings to opt out of this kind of tracking. But even the Federal Trade Commission has argued that changing your Venmo privacy settings has historically been too onerous. In February, PayPal settled with the regulatory agency over allegations that Venmo âmisled consumers about the extent to which they could keep their transactions private.â (Recently, even PayPal employees have questioned whether all transactions should be public by default, according to a Bloomberg story published earlier this week.) The FTC said Venmo didnât make it clear that users needed to change multiple settings in order to make their transactions truly hidden. The agency said the app also failed to disclose that one party in a transaction could retroactively change the privacy settings the other person set for the exchange. Venmo now includes a privacy tutorial pop-up for all new users, according to a spokesperson for the company. In the same complaint, the FTC also alleged that Venmo, at least until March 2015, âmisrepresented the extent of security it provided to consumer financial accounts,â by claiming that it had âbank-grade security protections.â While Venmo doesnât appear to make such claims on its website anymore, the app isn't a bank, even though we often treat it like one. Venmo won't, for example, typically provide the same level of customer service in the event your money is stolen. Venmo does offer some security protections, like requiring a unique pin be entered to access your account. But again, theyâre not enabled by default. If Venmo were the only cash-transfer app of its kind, then fine. But there are plenty of better options out there. Apple Pay Cash, the iPhone makerâs Venmo-equivalent, requires two-factor authentication on your Apple ID to start making payments. It was also rated the best peer-to-peer payment app by Consumer Reports earlier this month, largely for its robust security protections. One downside: You can only use it to transfer money between Apple devices. If you have an Android device, or simply want a payment app thatâs hardware neutral, Squareâs Cash app works great. The app's interface is sleek and easy to use, and there's no weird newsfeed. Sure, all your friends may be on Venmo, but maybe not for long: Square Cash is quickly growing more popular. The app was downloaded more times than Venmo in July and, as of earlier this week, it ranked higher than Venmo in the Apple App Store in the free finance apps category. For the most part, Square Cash and Venmo share many of the same features. One downside to Square Cash is that it charges a 1.5 percent fee to instantly transfer a payment to your bank account, while Venmo only charges 25 cents. That higher fee can be a pain if you need to move a large amount of money quickly, but neither app charges anything for non-rush bank transfers, which typically occur the next business day. Square Cash also allows you to discover users nearby using Bluetooth, lowering the possibility of sending beer money to the wrong John Smith. If youâd rather not download a new app, both Facebook and Google offer ways to send and receive money through services you may already use, like Gmail and Messenger. Your banking app may also already have the payment transfer service Zelle built into it, which could become more popular than Venmo this year. An additional upside to these services is that you can use many of them from your desktop. Venmo, on the other hand, recently announced plans to disable its web functionality, making it mobile-only. You likely already have several Venmo alternatives waiting for you on your phone. At the very most, youâll need to convince your friends to download Square Cash in order to fully rid yourself of Venmoâs strange news feed. I, for one, already have it installed.
